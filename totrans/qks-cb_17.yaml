- en: In this book, minikube 1.7.3 and Kubernetes 1.17.3 has been used; but again,
    any other version should be fine because no advanced techniques are used. Minikube
    requires a hypervisor to be installed. We recommend you use the VirtualBox hypervisor.
    In our experience, this is the most portable and stable way to run minikube.
