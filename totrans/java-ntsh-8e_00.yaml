- en: This book is a desktop Java reference, designed to sit faithfully by your keyboard
    while you program. [Part I, “Introducing Java”](part01.xhtml#javanut-PART-1) is
    a fast-paced, “no-fluff” introduction to the Java programming language and the
    core runtime aspects of the Java platform. [Part II, “Working with the Java Platform”](part02.xhtml#javanut-PART-2)
    is a reference section that blends elucidation of core concepts with examples
    of important core APIs. The book covers Java 17, but we recognize that some shops
    may not have adopted it yet—so where possible we call out if a feature was introduced
    after Java 8. We use Java 17 syntax throughout, including `var` and lambda expressions.

- en: The seventh edition of this book covers Java 11, whereas this edition covers
    Java 17. However, the release process of Java changed significantly with the arrival
    of Java 9, and certain releases of Java are now badged as *long-term support*
    (LTS) releases. So, Java 17 is the next LTS release of Java after Java 11.

- en: With the eighth edition we have tried to update the concept of what it means
    to be a “Nutshell” guide. The modern Java developer needs to know more than just
    syntax and APIs. As the Java environment has matured, such topics as concurrency,
    object-oriented design, memory, and the Java type system have all grown in importance
    for all developers.

- en: In this edition, we have taken the approach that only the most recent versions
    of Java are likely to be of interest to the majority of Java developers, so we
    usually only call out when new features arrived after Java 8.
  id: totrans-5
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, the module system (that arrived with Java 9) is still likely to
    be new for at least some developers, and it represents a major change. However,
    it is also something of an advanced topic and is in someways separate from the
    rest of the language, so we have restricted our treatment of it to a single chapter.

    substantial programming experience. Experienced Java programmers can use it as
    a language reference. Programmers with substantial experience with languages such
    as C and C++ should be able to pick up Java syntax quickly by reading this chapter;
    beginning programmers with only a modest amount of experience should be able to
    learn Java programming by studying this chapter carefully, although it is best
    read in conjunction with an introductory text (such as O’Reilly’s [*Head First
