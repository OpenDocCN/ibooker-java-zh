<p>Welcome to <em>Spring Boot: Up and Running</em>. I’m glad you’re here.</p>

<p>There are other Spring Boot books available today. Good books, written by good people. But every author makes decisions on what to include in their material, what to exclude, how to present what makes the cut, and so many more decisions large and small that make their book unique. What feels like optional material to one author may seem absolutely essential to another. We’re all developers, and like all developers, we have opinions.</p>

<p>My opinion was that there were some missing pieces, things I felt were either necessary or just incredibly helpful to share with devs new to Spring Boot. This list of missing pieces has grown as I interact with more and more developers around the world, at various stages in their Spring Boot journey. We’re all learning different things at different times in different ways. Thus this book.</p>

<p>If you’re new to Spring Boot, or if you feel it would be useful to strengthen your knowledge of the fundamentals — and let’s face it, when is it <em>not</em> useful to do that? — this book was written with you in mind. It is a gentle introduction that covers the key capabilities of Spring Boot while advancing into useful application of those capabilities <em>in the real world</em>.</p>

<p>Thank you for joining me on this journey. Let’s begin!</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Acknowledgments"><div class="sect1" id="idm45693974052392">
<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>I can’t say thank you enough to everyone who encouraged me to write this book and who encouraged me while I was writing it. If you read early releases and offered feedback or even a kind word on Twitter, you’ve no idea how much it meant to me. You have my deepest thanks.</p>

<p>There are a few people who made it all possible, and not just a hopeful plan to write this book someday:</p>

<p>To my boss, mentor, and friend Tasha Isenberg. Tasha, you worked with me to accommodate timelines and when push came to shove, cleared a path for me to sprint through and hit key deadlines. I’m truly grateful to have such an understanding champion and fierce advocate within VMware.</p>

<p>To Dr. David Syer, founder of Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Batch, and contributor to countless Spring projects. Your insights and feedback were truly exceptional and incredibly thoughtful, and I can’t thank you enough for everything.</p>

<p>To Greg Turnquist, Spring Data team member. Thanks for your critical eye and unfiltered feedback; you provided an invaluable additional perspective and made the book markedly better by doing so.</p>

<p>To my editors, Corbin Collins and Suzanne (Zan) McQuade. You were supportive in the extreme from concept to completion, encouraging me to produce my best work and somehow meet deadlines that outside circumstances seemed intent on crushing. I couldn’t have asked for better.</p>

<p>To Rob Romano, Caitlin Ghegan, Kim Sandoval, and the entire O’Reilly production team. You got me across the finish line, stepping in to fuel that all-important last mile and literally and figuratively get this book <em>into production</em>.</p>

<p>Finally and most importantly, to my brilliant, loving, and exceedingly patient wife Kathy. To say that you inspire and enable me to do all that I do is the greatest of understatements. From the depths of my heart, thank you for <em>everything</em>.</p>
