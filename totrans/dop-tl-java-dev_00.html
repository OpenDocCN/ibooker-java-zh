<h1>Preface</h1>


<p>This book was written in a time of immense change as<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="COVID-19 pandemic" id="idm45310225121008"/> the world was thrown upside down by the largest pandemic in a century. However, this work was never needed more as the software industry embraced DevOps and cloud native development to handle the accelerated pace of software delivery.</p>

<p>We organized this book so that the topics are in an incremental order of lifecycle, complexity, and maturity. However, DevOps is a broad enough journey that you may find some chapters more relevant than others for your project needs. As a result, we designed the chapters so that you can start in any order and focus on a particular subject for which you need expertise, examples, and best practices to advance your knowledge.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy reading this title as much as we have enjoyed putting the content together. Our one ask is that you share your newfound knowledge with a friend or colleague so that we can all become better developers.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Acknowledgments"><div class="sect1" id="idm45310223659568">
<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>This book wouldn’t have been possible without the support of our family and friends who stood with us and supported our dedication and focus on this subject. While we passionately worked to put this title together, they helped to take care of our loved ones and personal health so we could deliver the broad range of content required to cover the entire DevOps and Java ecosystem.</p>

<p>Also, a special thanks to Shlomi Ben Haim, CEO of JFrog. When other companies were pulling back and tightening budgets, Shlomi extended personal support for this title and gave us the freedom and flexibility to focus on the intense task of covering this extremely broad subject.</p>

<p>Special thanks to Ana-Maria Mihalceanu, for <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.xhtml#cloud_native_deployment">Chapter 8</a>, and to Sven Ruppert, for his contribution to <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.xhtml#securing_your_binaries">Chapter 7</a>.</p>

<p>We would like to thank our technical reviewers, Daniel Pittman, Cameron Pietrafeso, Sebastian Daschner, and Kirk Pepperdine, for improving the accuracy of this book.</p>

<p>And finally a huge thanks to you, the reader, who has taken the initiative to improve your knowledge of the entire DevOps pipeline and be a change agent for improvements in automation, process, and culture.</p>
