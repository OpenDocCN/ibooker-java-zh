<p>Selenium is an open source umbrella project composed of three core components: WebDriver, Grid, and IDE. Selenium provides advanced capabilities for browser automation that practitioners typically use for implementing end-to-end tests for web applications. This first part of the book is a comprehensive overview of the Selenium project and its ecosystem. Moreover, it provides a primer on the software testing theory, focusing on its practical applications for Selenium WebDriver. Finally, you will discover how to set up a project (using Maven or Gradle) for developing WebDriver tests. For the sake of completeness, I cover different alternatives regarding the unit testing framework used to embed the calls to the Selenium WebDriver API, namely, JUnit 4, JUnit 5 (alone or extended by Selenium-Jupiter), and TestNG.</p>&#13;
