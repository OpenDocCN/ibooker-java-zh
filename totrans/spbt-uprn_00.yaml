- en: There are other Spring Boot books available today. Good books, written by good
    people. But every author makes decisions on what to include in their material,
    what to exclude, how to present what makes the cut, and so many more decisions
    large and small that make their book unique. What feels like optional material
    to one author may seem absolutely essential to another. We’re all developers,
    and like all developers, we have opinions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My opinion was that there were some missing pieces, things I felt were either
    necessary or just incredibly helpful to share with devs new to Spring Boot. This
    list of missing pieces has grown as I interact with more and more developers around
    the world, at various stages in their Spring Boot journey. We’re all learning
    different things at different times in different ways. Thus this book.

    your knowledge of the fundamentals — and let’s face it, when is it *not* useful
    to do that? — this book was written with you in mind. It is a gentle introduction
    that covers the key capabilities of Spring Boot while advancing into useful application
    of those capabilities *in the real world*.

- en: I can’t say thank you enough to everyone who encouraged me to write this book
    and who encouraged me while I was writing it. If you read early releases and offered
    feedback or even a kind word on Twitter, you’ve no idea how much it meant to me.
    You have my deepest thanks.

- en: To my boss, mentor, and friend Tasha Isenberg. Tasha, you worked with me to
    accommodate timelines and when push came to shove, cleared a path for me to sprint
    through and hit key deadlines. I’m truly grateful to have such an understanding
    champion and fierce advocate within VMware.
  prefs: []

    to countless Spring projects. Your insights and feedback were truly exceptional
    and incredibly thoughtful, and I can’t thank you enough for everything.

    unfiltered feedback; you provided an invaluable additional perspective and made
    the book markedly better by doing so.

    in the extreme from concept to completion, encouraging me to produce my best work
    and somehow meet deadlines that outside circumstances seemed intent on crushing.
    I couldn’t have asked for better.

    team. You got me across the finish line, stepping in to fuel that all-important
    last mile and literally and figuratively get this book *into production*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally and most importantly, to my brilliant, loving, and exceedingly patient
    wife Kathy. To say that you inspire and enable me to do all that I do is the greatest
    of understatements. From the depths of my heart, thank you for *everything*.
