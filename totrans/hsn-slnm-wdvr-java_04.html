<p>Selenium WebDriver is an open source library that allows controlling web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge, or Firefox, to name a few) programmatically as a real user would do. It provides a cross-browser API that you can use to implement end-to-end tests for web applications. This part of the book presents an in-depth summary of the Selenium WebDriver API. The following chapters aim to be very practical. For this reason, I explain each feature of the Selenium WebDriver API using ready-to-use tests available on the examples repository in GitHub.</p>&#13;
