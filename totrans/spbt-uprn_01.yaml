- en: If you’ve been developing software of any import for any length of time, you’ve
    almost certainly had to contend with several headaches surrounding dependency
    management. Any capability you provide in your application typically requires
    a number of “frontline” dependencies. For example, if you want to provide a RESTful
    web API, you must provide a way to expose endpoints over HTTP, listen for requests,
    tie those endpoints to methods/functions that will process those requests, and
    then build and return appropriate responses.
  id: totrans-6
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Almost invariably, each primary dependency incorporates numerous other secondary
    dependencies in order to fulfill its promised functionality. Continuing with our
    example of providing a RESTful API, we might expect to see a collection of dependencies
    (in some sensible but debatable structure) that includes code to supply responses
    in a particular format, e.g., JSON, XML, HTML; code to marshal/unmarshal objects
    to requested format(s); code to listen for and process requests and return responses
    to same; code to decode complex URIs used to create versatile APIs; code to support
    various wire protocols; and more.
  id: totrans-7
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even for this fairly simple example, we’re already likely to require a large
    number of dependencies in our build file. And we haven’t even considered what
    functionality we may wish to include in our application at this point, only its
    outward interactions.

- en: Now, let’s talk versions. Of each and every one of those dependencies.
  id: totrans-9
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using libraries together requires a certain degree of rigor, as one version
    of a particular dependency may have been tested (or even function correctly) only
    with a specific version of another dependency. When these issues inevitably arise,
    it leads to what I refer to as “Dependency Whack-a-Mole.”
  id: totrans-10

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like its namesake carnival game, Dependency Whack-a-Mole can be a frustrating
    experience. Unlike its namesake, when it comes to chasing down and bashing bugs
    stemming from mismatches that pop up between dependencies, there are no prizes,
    only elusive conclusive diagnoses and *hours* wasted pursuing them.

- en: Enter Spring Boot and its starters. Spring Boot starters are Bills of Materials
    (BOMs) built around the proven premise that the vast majority of times you provide
    a particular capability, you do it in nearly the same way, nearly every time.
  id: totrans-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the previous example, each time we build an API, we expose endpoints, listen
    for requests, process requests, convert to and from objects, exchange information
    in 1+ standard formats, send and receive data over the wire using a particular
    protocol, and more. This design/development/usage pattern doesn’t vary much; it’s
    an approach adopted industry-wide, with few variations. And like other similar
    patterns, it’s handily captured in a Spring Boot starter.
  id: totrans-13
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Adding a single starter, e.g., `spring-boot-starter-web`, provides all of those
    related functionalities in a *single application dependency*. All dependencies
    encompassed by that single starter are version-synchronized too, meaning that
    they’ve been tested successfully together and the included version of library
    A is proven to function properly with the included version of library B…and C…and
    D…etc. This dramatically simplifies your dependency list and your life, as it
    practically eliminates any chance you’ll have difficult-to-identify version conflicts
    among dependencies you need to provide your application’s critical capabilities.

    version of an included dependency, you can simply override the tested version.

    probably increase your level of testing to mitigate risks you introduce by doing
    so.

    but the same cautionary note applies.

- en: All in all, Spring Boot’s concept of starters greatly streamlines your dependencies
    and reduces the work required to add whole sets of capabilities to your applications.
    It also dramatically diminishes the overhead you incur testing, maintaining, and
    upgrading them.

- en: 'Spring Boot wasn’t the origin of the so-called über JAR, but it revolutionized
    it. Rather than teasing out every file from the application JAR and all dependent
    JARs, then combining them into a single destination JAR—sometimes referred to
    as *shading*—the designers of Spring Boot approached things from a truly novel
    perspective: what if we could *nest JARs*, retaining their intended and delivered
    format?'
  id: totrans-31
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nesting JARs instead of shading them alleviates *many* potential problems, as
    there are no potential version conflicts to be encountered when dependency JAR
    A and dependency JAR B each use a different version of C; it also removes potential
    legal issues due to repackaging software and combining it with other software
    using a different license. Keeping all dependent JARs in their original format
    cleanly avoids those and other issues.

    should you wish to do that. There are some good reasons for doing so in some circumstances,
    and I’ll discuss those in this book as well. For now, just know that the Spring
    Boot executable JAR has you covered.

- en: That single Spring Boot JAR with all dependencies makes deployment a breeze.
    Rather than collecting and verifying all dependencies are deployed, the Spring
    Boot plug-in ensures they’re all zipped into the output JAR. Once you have that,
    the application can be run anywhere there is a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) just
    by executing a command like `java -jar <SpringBootAppName.jar>`.

  id: totrans-35

    can also make that single JAR entirely (self) executable. Still assuming a JVM
    is present, rather than having to type or script that entire bothersome line of
    `java -jar <SpringBootAppName.jar>`, you could simply type `<SpringBootAppName.jar>`
    (replacing with your filename, of course), and Bob’s your uncle—you’re up and
    running. It doesn’t get any easier than that.

    that some patterns repeat themselves frequently. Not perfectly, of course, but
    in the high percentages; perhaps 80–90% of the time things fall within a certain
    range of design, development, or activity.
  id: totrans-40
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I alluded earlier to this repetition within software, as this is what makes
    Spring Boot’s starters amazingly consistent and useful. The repetition also means
    that these activities, when it comes to the code that must be written to complete
    a particular task, are ripe for streamlining.
  id: totrans-41
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To borrow an example from Spring Data, a Spring Boot–related and –enabled project,
    we know that every time we need to access a database, we need to open some manner
    of connection to that database. We also know that when our application completes
    its tasks, that connection must be closed to avoid potential issues. In between,
    we are likely to make numerous requests to the database using queries—simple and
    complex, read-only and write-enabled—and those queries will require some effort
    to create properly.
  id: totrans-42
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now imagine we could streamline all of that. Automatically open a connection
    when we specify the database. Automatically close the connection when the application
    terminates. Follow a simple and expected convention to create queries *automatically*
    with minimal effort from you, the developer. Enable easy customization of even
    that minimal code, again by simple convention, to create complex bespoke queries
    that are reliably consistent and efficient.
  id: totrans-43
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This approach to code is sometimes referred to as *convention over configuration*,
    and if you’re new to a particular convention, it can appear mildly jarring (no
    pun intended) at first glance. But if you’ve implemented similar features before,
    writing often hundreds of repetitive, mind-numbing lines of setup/teardown/configuration
    code to accomplish even the simplest of tasks, it’s like a gust of fresh air.
    Spring Boot (and most Spring projects) follow the *convention over configuration*
    mantra, providing the assurance that if you follow simple, well-established and
    -documented conventions to do something, the configuration code you must write
    is minimal, or none at all.
  id: totrans-44
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way in which autoconfiguration gives you superpowers is the Spring team’s
    laserlike focus on “developer-first” environment configuration. As developers,
    we are most productive when we can focus on the task at hand and not a million
    setup chores. How does Spring Boot make that happen?
  id: totrans-45
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Let’s borrow an example from another Spring Boot–related project, Spring Cloud
    Stream: when connecting to a messaging platform like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka,
    a developer typically must specify certain settings for said messaging platform
    in order to connect to and use it—hostname, port, credentials, and more. Focusing
    on the development experience means that defaults are provided when none are specified
    that *favor the developer working locally*: localhost, default port, etc. This
    makes sense as an *opinion* because it’s nearly 100% consistent for development
    environments, while it isn’t so in production. In prod, you would need to provide
    specific values due to widely varying platform and hosting environments.'
  id: totrans-46
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of time required for developer environment setup. Win for you, win for your team.

- en: There are occasions when your specific use cases don’t exactly match the 80–90%
    of use cases that are typical, when you fall into the other 10–20% of valid use
    cases. In those instances, autoconfiguration can be selectively overridden, or
    even disabled entirely, but you lose all of your superpowers then, of course.
    Overriding certain opinions is typically a matter of setting one or more properties
    as you wish them to be or providing one or more beans to accomplish something
    that Spring Boot would normally autoconfigure on your behalf. In other words,
    this is often a very simple matter to accomplish on those rare occasions when
    you must do so. In the end, autoconfiguration is a powerful tool that silently
    and tirelessly works on your behalf to make your life easier and you insanely
    productive.

  zh: 在一些情况下，您的具体用例可能并不完全符合典型用例的80–90%，而是属于另外的10–20%有效用例。在这些情况下，可以有选择地覆盖自动配置，甚至完全禁用它，但当然，您会失去所有的超能力。覆盖某些默认设置通常是通过设置一个或多个属性为您希望的值，或者提供一个或多个Bean来完成Spring
    Boot通常会为您自动配置的某些任务。换句话说，当您必须这样做时，通常这是一个非常简单的事情。总之，自动配置是一个强大的工具，默默无闻地为您工作，使您的生活更轻松，您的生产力更高。
