  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book was written in a time of immense change as the world was thrown upside
    down by the largest pandemic in a century. However, this work was never needed
    more as the software industry embraced DevOps and cloud native development to
    handle the accelerated pace of software delivery.

- en: We organized this book so that the topics are in an incremental order of lifecycle,
    complexity, and maturity. However, DevOps is a broad enough journey that you may
    find some chapters more relevant than others for your project needs. As a result,
    we designed the chapters so that you can start in any order and focus on a particular
    subject for which you need expertise, examples, and best practices to advance
    your knowledge.

    content together. Our one ask is that you share your newfound knowledge with a
    friend or colleague so that we can all become better developers.

- en: This book wouldn’t have been possible without the support of our family and
    friends who stood with us and supported our dedication and focus on this subject.
    While we passionately worked to put this title together, they helped to take care
    of our loved ones and personal health so we could deliver the broad range of content
    required to cover the entire DevOps and Java ecosystem.

    were pulling back and tightening budgets, Shlomi extended personal support for
    this title and gave us the freedom and flexibility to focus on the intense task
    of covering this extremely broad subject.
