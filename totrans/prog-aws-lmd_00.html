<h1>About This Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Welcome to <em>Programming AWS Lambda</em>. We’re glad you’re here!</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Serverless computing is a revolutionary way of building systems.&#13;
At its heart, serverless is about performing the minimum technical work necessary to sustainably provide value to our users. A serverless approach does this by making the most of services provided by cloud vendors, like Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In this book, you’ll learn how to architect, build, and operate serverless applications that use <em>AWS Lambda</em>—the original, and widely adopted, serverless compute platform.&#13;
AWS Lambda is rarely used by itself, however, and so while reading this book, you’ll also learn how to successfully integrate Lambda with other serverless AWS services, like S3, DynamoDB, and more.</p>&#13;

<h1>Why We Wrote This Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We have been using Lambda since 2015, ever since Lambda’s support for Java was first announced.&#13;
Within<a data-primary="AWS Lambda" data-secondary="benefits of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46222431803544"/> just a few weeks we saw the amazing ability that Lambda had to let teams build new features far faster than we’d ever seen before.&#13;
By removing a lot of low-level aspects of developing and running systems, and instead focusing on a clean, event-driven approach, we realized that many of the complexities that got in the way of our teams no longer applied when using Lambda.&#13;
Lambda also let us amplify our use of the rest of the AWS platform—it had a multiplicative impact on our effectiveness.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We initially had two concerns about Lambda—that it wouldn’t support the programming knowledge and software inventory that we’d built over the years in Java and that it would be far too expensive to run at scale.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>What we found instead surprised us.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Lambda’s support for Java was not merely an “add on.” In fact, Java is a first-class runtime within the Lambda platform.&#13;
Building Lambda applications in Java freed us to get back to the essence of programming, letting us use our skills and existing code.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Further, Lambda turned out to be less, not more, expensive to run than equivalent, traditionally built systems.&#13;
The efficiency of Lambda’s “pay-per-use” model, to sub-second precision, allowed us to create systems that processed hundreds of millions of events per day and yet were cheaper than their predecessors.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This combination of speed of development, embrace of existing languages, and cost effectiveness led us to believe that serverless compute platforms, with Lambda at their forefront, were the start of something special in our industry.&#13;
In 2016 we started our business, Symphonia, with the mission to help companies make the leap to this new way of building systems.</p>&#13;

<h1>Who This Book Is For</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This<a data-primary="intended audience" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46222431797144"/> book is intended primarily for software developers and software architects, but it will be useful to anyone involved in the technical aspects of building software applications in the cloud.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We<a data-primary="prerequisite knowledge" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46222431795688"/> assume that you already know or can learn the basics of the Java programming language.&#13;
You don’t need to have knowledge of, or experience with, any Java application frameworks (like Spring) or libraries (like Guava).&#13;
We do not assume that you have any prior knowledge of Amazon Web Services.</p>&#13;

<h1>Why You Need This Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In many ways serverless, and Lambda with it, is one of the most significant changes to building server-side software in decades.&#13;
While our code may look similar line by line, and perhaps even class by class, to how it was written before, the architectural constraints and capabilities of Lambda drive designs that have a very different shape than what you’ve seen in the past.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Over the last few years we’ve come to understand how to successfully build systems with Lambda. This book will give you a jump-start into learning these same lessons.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>From getting started techniques to advanced architecture, from programming and testing to deployment and monitoring, we cover the lifecycle of what you need to understand to build production-quality systems with Lambda at scale.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>What makes this book unique is we do all of this in the context of the Java programming language.&#13;
We’ve both been Java programmers for more than two decades each, so in this book we help you use your existing Java skills in a whole new way.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>So strap in, and welcome to the age of serverless!</p>&#13;

<h1>Using the End-of-Chapter Exercises</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Each<a data-primary="exercises" data-secondary="how to use" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46222428283000"/> chapter of this book ends with some exercises.&#13;
Some of these exercises encourage you to take the lessons of the chapter and see them working “for real” in the AWS Cloud.&#13;
While certain elements of Lambda can be simulated locally, you’ll only really get a feel for what Lambda development is like by using it in the context of the AWS platform.&#13;
The good news is that AWS provides a healthy <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free">“free tier”</a> that should allow you to experiment without incurring any costs.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Other exercises are intended to make you consider how you might work differently with Lambda compared with other technologies.&#13;
Serverless architecture is often a very different way of thinking, and working through these exercises will start adapting your brain in this way.</p>&#13;

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Thanks to our technical reviewers for giving their time and improving this book for you: Brian Gruber, Daniel Bryant, Sarah Wells, and Stuart Sierra.&#13;
Thanks to our former coworkers at Intent Media who joined in with using a wild new technology four years ago and showed us how it could transform teams.&#13;
Thanks to all of Symphonia’s clients, partners, and friends—we’re grateful for your continued trust and confidence.&#13;
Thanks to everyone at O’Reilly, especially our editorial team; it’s amazing to write our own “animal” book two decades and more after we started reading them.&#13;
And thanks to all of the folk in the serverless community who we’ve been sharing this ride with!</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Further thanks to the members of the AWS serverless team, especially Ajay Nair, Chris Munns, Noel Dowling, and Salman Paracha, for producing a revolutionary product and for chatting with us over the last few years.&#13;
Finally thanks to Tim Wagner for leading Lambda through its infancy and for writing the foreword to this book!</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>John’s acknowledgments:</em>&#13;
First and foremost, thank you to my parents, Mark and Bridget, who gave me the privilege and freedom to choose my own path in life and the love and support to not fall off of it.&#13;
Thanks of course to my coauthor and business partner, Mike, without whom this book and our company would have never existed—one day I’ll teach him how to write American English (but not today).&#13;
And endless thanks to my wife Jessica, who kept my spirits up and never asked what the word count was.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>Mike’s acknowledgments:</em> There’s too many people to thank here, but I’ll give it a go.&#13;
Thanks to my senior school computer studies teacher, Ray Lovell, and to my college tutor, Carroll Morgan.&#13;
Thanks to my colleagues through the years, especially from my time at ThoughtWorks.&#13;
Daniel Terhorst-North has been a mentor and brain-twister through most of my career; Daniel, please keep making me go “huh!?”&#13;
Thanks to Brian Guthrie, Lisa van Gelder, and the rest of the NYC eXtreme Tuesday Club community.&#13;
And to Mike Mason who has been a colleague (twice), a roommate (on several occasions), and the closest of friends for far more than half of my life. (Yes, Mike, The Phrase is in the book—it’s your turn again now!)</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>My most significant appreciation, however, goes to three people “without whom…”&#13;
First, thanks to Martin Fowler for inspiration, for friendship, and also for publishing my article on serverless architectures that led to what you’re reading here.&#13;
Next, thanks to my coauthor John for joining me in the roller coaster that is our company, Symphonia.&#13;
Finally, of course, thanks to my wonderful spouse, Sara, who supports both the strange hours of me being self-employed and apparently me now being a published author.</p>&#13;
