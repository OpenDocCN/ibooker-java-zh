<p class="author1">This book presents a phased approach to building and deploying more reliable Java microservices. The capabilities presented in each chapter are meant to be followed in order, each building upon the capabilities of earlier chapters. There are five phases in this journey:</p>
<ol class="calibre4">
<li class="calibre5">
<p class="calibre18">Measure and monitor your services for availability.</p>
</li>
<li class="calibre5">
<p class="calibre18">Add debuggability signals that allow you to ask questions about periods of unavailability.</p>
</li>
<li class="calibre5">
<p class="calibre18">Improve your software delivery pipeline to limit the chance of introducing more failure.</p>
</li>
<li class="calibre5">
<p class="calibre18">Build the capability to observe the state of deployed assets all the way down to source code.</p>
</li>
<li class="calibre5">
<p class="calibre18">Add just enough traffic management to bring your services up to a level of availability you are satisfied with.</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p class="author1">Our goal isn’t to build a perfect system, to eliminate all failure. Our goal is to end with a highly reliable system and avoid spending time in the space of diminishing returns.</p>

<p class="author1">Avoiding diminishing returns is why we will spend so much time talking about effective measurement and monitoring, and why this discipline precedes all others.</p>

<p class="author1">If you are in engineering management, <a data-type="xref" href="part0005_split_000.html#4OIQ4-2d714b853a094e9a910510217e0e3d73" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre4 pcalibre">Chapter 1</a> is your mission statement: to build an application platform renowned for its reliability and the culture of an effective platform engineering team that can deliver these capabilities to a broader engineering organization.</p>

<p class="author1">The chapters that follow contain the blueprints for achieving this mission, targeted at engineers. This book is intentionally narrowed in scope to <em class="calibre12">Java</em> microservices precisely so that I can offer detailed advice on how to go about this, including specific measurements battle-tested for Java microservices, code samples, and other <span class="keep-together">idiosyncracies</span> like dependency management concerns that are unique to the Java virtual machine (JVM). Its focus is on immediate actionability.</p>

<h1 class="calibre19" id="calibre_pb_1">My Journey</h1>

<p class="author1">My professional journey in software engineering forms an arc that led me to write this book:</p>

<ul class="printings">
<li class="calibre15">
<p class="calibre18">A scrappy custom software startup</p>
</li>
<li class="calibre15">
<p class="calibre18">A traditional insurance company called Shelter Insurance in Missouri</p>
</li>
<li class="calibre15">
<p class="calibre18">Netflix in Silicon Valley</p>
</li>
<li class="calibre15">
<p class="calibre18">A Spring team engineer working remotely</p>
</li>
<li class="calibre15">
<p class="calibre18">A Gradle engineer</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="author1">When I left Shelter Insurance, despite my efforts, I didn’t understand public cloud. In almost seven years there, I had interacted with the same group of named virtual machines (bare metal actually, originally). I was used to quarterly release cycles and extensive manual testing before releases. I felt like leaders emphasized and reemphasized how “hard” we expected code freezes to be leading up to releases, how after a release a code freeze wasn’t as hard as we would have liked, etc. I had never experienced production monitoring of an application—that was the responsibility of a network operations center, a room my badge didn’t provide access to because I didn’t need to know what happened there. This organization was successful by most measures. It has changed significantly in some ways since then, and little in others. I’m thankful for the opportunity to have learned under some fantastic engineers there.</p>

<p class="author1">At Netflix I learned valuable lessons about engineering and culture. I left after a time with a great sense of hope that some of these same practices could be applied to a company like Shelter Insurance, and joined the Spring team. When I founded the open source metrics library Micrometer, it was with a deep appreciation of the fact that organizations are on a journey. Rather than supporting just the best-in-class monitoring systems of today, Micrometer’s first five monitoring system implementations contained three legacy monitoring systems that I knew were still in significant use.</p>

<p class="author1">A couple of years working with and advising enterprises of various sizes on application monitoring and delivery automation with Spinnaker gave me an idea of both the diversity of organizational dynamics and their commonalities. It is my understanding of the commonalities, those practices and techniques that every enterprise could benefit from, that form the substance of this book. Every enterprise Java organization can apply these techniques, given a bit of time and practice. That includes your <span class="keep-together">organization.</span></p>

<dl class="calibre20">
<dt class="calibre21">Olga Kundzich</dt>
<dd class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">What I didn’t know before writing this book is how much voices from an author’s circle of colleagues find their way into a book. It makes complete sense, of course. We influence each other simply by working together! Olga’s insightful views on a wide range of topics have probably had the greatest single influence on my thinking in the last couple of years, and her voice is everywhere in this book (or at least the best approximation of it I can represent). Thoughts you’ll find on “the application platform,” continuous delivery (no no, not continuous deployment—I kept confusing the two), asset inventory, monitoring, and elements of traffic management are heavily influenced by her. Thank you Olga for investing so much energy into this book.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="calibre21">Troy Gaines</dt>
<dd class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">To Troy I owe my initial introduction to dependency management, build automation, continuous integration, unit testing, and so many other essential skills. He was an early and significant influence in my growth as a software developer, as I know he has been to many others. Thank you, old friend, for taking the time to review this work as well.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="calibre21">Tommy Ludwig</dt>
<dd class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">Tommy is one of the rare telemetry experts that contributes to both distributed tracing and aggregated metrics technologies. It is so common that contributors in the observability space are hyper-focused on one area of it, and Tommy is one of the few that floats between them. To put it mildly, I dreaded Tommy’s review of Chapter 3, but was happy to find that we had more in common on this than I expected. Thanks for pointing out the more nuanced view of distributed tracing tag cardinality that made its way into Chapter 3.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="calibre21">Sam Snyder</dt>
<dd class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">I haven’t known Sam for long, but it didn’t take long for me to understand that Sam is an excellent mentor and patient teacher. Thank you Sam for agreeing to subject yourself to the arduous task of reviewing a technical book, and leaving so much positive and encouraging feedback.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="calibre21">Mike McGarr</dt>
<dd class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">I received an email out of the blue from Mike in 2014 that, a short time later, resulted in me packing everything up and moving to California. That email set me on a course that changed everything. I came to know so many experts at Netflix that accelerated me through the learning process because Mike took a chance on me. It radically changed the way I view software development and operations. Mike is also just a fantastic human being—a kind and inquisitive friend and leader. Thanks, Mike.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="calibre21">Josh Long</dt>
<dd class="calibre22">
<p class="calibre23">Once in the book, I quoted a typical Josh Long phrase about there being “no place like” production. I thought I was being cheeky and fun. And then Josh wrote a foreword that features Buzz Lightyear…Josh is an unstoppable ball of energy. Thank you Josh for injecting a bit of that energy into this work.</p>
