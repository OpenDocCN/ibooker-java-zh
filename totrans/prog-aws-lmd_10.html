<h1><span class="label">Chapter 10. </span>Conclusion</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>The goal of this book was for you to learn what it means to build and run applications using serverless technology on AWS, with AWS Lambda at the core of those systems.&#13;
We hope that you feel empowered to do this, safe in the knowledge that Java is truly a first-class language choice in the serverless world.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We<a data-primary="AWS Lambda" data-secondary="tips for using" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46222411480696"/> encourage you to reflect on some of the points we’ve tried to emphasize in this book:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Above all, know that trying out ideas with serverless systems is quick, and cheap. If in doubt, experiment!</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Remember that Lambda code is “just code.” Lambda is not a framework, or an “application server” in the traditional sense—your Lambda functions are just small pieces of Java that process a JSON event. This makes unit testing, and incremental development within your IDE, fast and nimble. Similarly, try not to bloat your functions with unnecessary libraries and frameworks that were designed for alternative runtime models.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Automate<a data-primary="Lambda functions" data-secondary="tips for creating and using" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46222411475736"/> the scripting of building and deploying your functions to the AWS Cloud. You want to be able to rapidly iterate in the same environment that will be processing production events. Use the techniques we’ve shown throughout the book with Maven, SAM, and CloudFormation to enable this.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>As<a data-primary="testing" data-secondary="tips for using" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46222411473496"/> we showed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>, spend most of your testing time on quick unit and functional tests that run locally within one JVM along with functions under test, but also invest in the automation of end-to-end tests that exercise your functions running on the Lambda platform.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Try to keep each of your Lambda functions focused on solving one task. Just include the code and libraries necessary to handle each function’s own events. Where necessary, use code sharing as we described in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#multi-module-build-and-package">“Build and Package Using Multiple Modules and Isolated Artifacts”</a>.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Don’t<a data-primary="cold starts" data-secondary="advice on" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46222411468488"/> give in to the fear of cold starts! Typically either they won’t be a concern for you once your application is in production, or you can use one or more remediation techniques if necessary.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Secure<a data-primary="security" data-secondary="tips for implementing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46222411466312"/> your serverless applications appropriately, considering the principle of least privilege, using AWS IAM. Your organization may end up with thousands of deployed Lambda functions, so you want to reduce the blast radius of each to reduce the impact of bugs or perhaps malicious intent.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Remember<a data-primary="logging" data-secondary="tips for using" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46222411464040"/><a data-primary="metrics" data-secondary="tips for using" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46222411463032"/> that logging and metrics work a little differently in this new world of Lambda. Use structured logging as much as you can; remember that you want to be able to observe behavior of your complete system, not just an individual function. Consider what metrics best indicate the health of the system as far as your users are concerned.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>As<a data-primary="serverless applications" data-secondary="event-driven approach to" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46222411460776"/> you build your serverless applications, embrace an “event-driven” mode of thinking. Even for functions invoked synchronously, consider how each invocation represents the passing of a self-contained message from one component to the next. And then think about how you can make your system as asynchronous as possible.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Don’t necessarily throw away your nonserverless services. Things like relational databases might still be the best way for you to solve certain problems, especially if they already exist in your larger ecosystem. But do think carefully about how to use them in a world where scale is handled very differently.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Finally, serverless is a lot bigger than just Lambda—consider how you can lean on BaaS products from AWS and others to reduce the amount of code you need to write and operate. Even when you’ve settled on a particular service, investigate all of its features—it may have some hidden gems that can save you days or weeks of work.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We<a data-primary="AWS Lambda" data-secondary="resources for learning about" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46222411456536"/> hope you’ve enjoyed this book, have found it valuable, and that it continues to be a useful resource to you over the coming months and years. We will continue to write and speak about what we learn and build with Lambda and other AWS technologies.</p>&#13;
