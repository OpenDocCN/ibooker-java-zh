<h1>Preface</h1>


<p>Mastering software development involves learning a disparate set of concepts.
If you’re starting out as a junior software developer, or even if you’re more experienced, it can seem like an
insurmountable hurdle. Should you be spending time learning about established topics in the object-oriented world
such as SOLID principles, design patterns, or test-driven development? Should you be trying out things that are
becoming increasingly popular such as functional programming?</p>

<p>Even once you’ve picked some topics to learn it’s often hard to identify how they fit together. When you should go
down the route of applying functional programming ideas in your project? When do you worry about testing? How do you
know at what point to introduce or refine these techniques? Do you need
to read a book on each of these topics and then another set of blog posts or videos to explain how to put things
together? Where do you even start?</p>

<p>Don’t worry, this book is here to help you. You will be helped through an integrated, project-driven approach to
learning. You’ll learn the core topics that you need to know in order to become a productive developer. Not only that,
but we show how these things fit together into bigger projects.</p>






<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Why We Wrote This Book"><div class="sect1" id="idm45816840113224">
<h1>Why We Wrote This Book</h1>

<p>Over the years we have built up a wealth of experience around teaching developers to code. We have both
written books on Java 8 onward and run training courses around professional software development. In the process we’ve
been recognized as Java Champions and international conference speakers.</p>

<p>We’ve found over the years that many developers could benefit from either an introduction or a refresher on several core topics. Design patterns, functional programming, SOLID principles, and testing are practices that often get good coverage in their own right, but it’s rarely shown how they work well and fit together. People
sometimes even get put off from improving their skills simply due to the paralysis of choice over what to learn. We
want to not only teach people core skills, but do so in a way that’s easy to approach and fun, too.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="A Developer-Oriented Approach"><div class="sect1" id="idm45816839834008">
<h1>A Developer-Oriented Approach</h1>

<p>This book also gives you the opportunity to learn in a developer-oriented way. It contains plenty of code samples and
whenever we introduce a topic we always provide concrete code examples.
You get all the code for the projects within the book, so if you want to follow along you can even step through the book
code in an <em>Integrated Development Environment</em> (IDE) or run the programs in order to try them out.</p>

<p>Another common bugbear when it comes to technical books is that they are often written in a formal, lecturing style.
That’s not how normal people speak to each other! In this book you’ll get a conversational style that helps to engage
you in the content rather than being patronizing.</p>
</div></section>













<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="What’s in the Book?"><div class="sect1" id="idm45816839843544">
<h1>What’s in the Book?</h1>

<p>Each chapter is structured around a software project. At the end of a chapter, if you’ve been following along,
you should be able to write that project. The projects start off as simple command-line batch programs but grow in
complexity to fully fledged <span class="keep-together">applications</span>.</p>

<p>You’ll benefit from a project-driven structure in a variety of ways. First, you get to see how
different programming techniques work together in an integrated setting. When we look at functional programming toward
the end of the book, it isn’t just abstract collection-processing operations—they’re presented in order to calculate actual
results used by the project in question. This solves the problem of educational material showing good ideas or approaches,
but developers often use them inappropriately or out of context.</p>

<p>Second, a project-driven approach helps ensure that at each stage you see realistic examples. Educational
materials are often full of example classes called <code>Foo</code> and methods called <code>bar</code>. Our examples are relevant to the projects
in question and show how to apply the ideas to real problems, similar to the ones that you may encounter in your career.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s more fun and engaging to learn this way. Each chapter is a fresh project and a fresh opportunity
to learn new things. We want you to read through to the end and really enjoy turning the pages as you’re reading.
The chapters start with a challenge that will be solved, walk you through the solution, and then end by evaluating what
you learned and how the challenge was solved. We specifically call out the challenge at the beginning and end of
every chapter to ensure that its goals are clear to you.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Who Should Read This Book?"><div class="sect1" id="idm45816839778168">
<h1>Who Should Read This Book?</h1>

<p>We’re confident that developers from a wide variety of backgrounds will find things that are useful and interesting
in this book. Having said that, there are some people who will get the maximum value out of this book.</p>

<p>Junior software developers, often just out of university or a couple of years into their programming career, are who
we think of as the core audience for this book. You’ll learn about fundamental topics that we expect to be of
relevance throughout your software development career. You don’t need to have a university degree by any means, but
you do need to know the basics of programming in order to make the best use of this book. We won’t explain what an if
statement or a loop is, for example.</p>

<p>You don’t need to know much about object-oriented or functional programming in order to get started. In <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.xhtml#chapter_02">Chapter 2</a>, we make no assumptions beyond that you know what a class is and can use collections with generics (e.g., <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code>). We take it right from the basics.</p>

<p>Another group who will find this book of particular interest is developers learning Java while coming from another
programming language, such as C#, C++, or Python. This book helps you quickly get up to speed with the language
constructs and also the principles, practices, and idioms that are important to write good Java code.</p>

<p>If you’re a more experienced Java developer, you may want to skip <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.xhtml#chapter_02">Chapter 2</a> in order to avoid repeating
basic material that you already know, but <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.xhtml#chapter_03">Chapter 3</a> onward will be full of concepts and approaches that will be of benefit to many
developers.</p>

<p>We’ve found that learning can be one of the most fun parts of software development and hope that you’ll find that as
well when reading this book. We hope you have fun on this journey.</p>
