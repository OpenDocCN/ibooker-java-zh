<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>In the IT world, the limits of today are the gateways of tomorrow.&#13;
In the last 50 years, the IT world has continuously evolved, tirelessly, always pushing the limits.&#13;
These changes are due to not only technical progress, but also us, the consumers.&#13;
As consumers, we continue to demand more and more from the software we interact with every day.&#13;
In addition, our way of interacting with software has entirely changed.&#13;
We can’t live without mobile applications and devices and now accept receiving notifications all day long.&#13;
The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging market promising many more innovations, increasing the number of events and data processed uninterruptedly.&#13;
The cloud and Kubernetes have not only changed our usage but also radically transformed the way we design, develop, deploy, and maintain applications.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>But don’t be mistaken; all these revolutions come with a price.&#13;
While they have enabled new uses and applications, they have also introduced massive complexity.&#13;
Most software systems today are distributed systems.&#13;
And distributed systems are hard to design, build, and operate, especially on the scale we need to implement these new modern applications.&#13;
We need to handle failures, asynchronous communication, an ever-changing topology, the dynamic availability of resources, and so on.&#13;
While the cloud promises unlimited resources, money is a limiting factor, and increasing the deployment density, meaning running more on fewer resources, becomes a stringent concern.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Reactive" data-secondary="explanation of term" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358844326480"/>So, what about Reactive?&#13;
It is not a library you use in your code or a magic framework.&#13;
<em>Reactive</em> is a set of principles, tools, methodologies, and frameworks that lead to building <em>better</em> distributed systems.&#13;
How <em>much</em> better?&#13;
It depends on the system, but applications following the Reactive principles embrace distributed systems’ challenges and focus on elasticity, resilience, and responsiveness, as explained in <a href="https://oreil.ly/fO6n0">The Reactive Manifesto</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In this book, we use the noun <em>Reactive</em>, with an uppercase <em>R</em>, to aggregate all the various facets of the reactive landscape, such as reactive programming, reactive systems, reactive streams, and so on.&#13;
With this book, you’ll learn how Reactive will help us face these new concerns and how it fits in cloud environments.&#13;
After reading this book, you will be able to build reactive systems—resilient, adaptable, event-driven distributed systems.</p>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Who Should Read This Book?" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45358844298800">&#13;
<h1>Who Should Read This Book?</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book targets intermediate and advanced Java developers.&#13;
It would be best if you were reasonably comfortable with Java; however, prior knowledge of reactive programming or even Reactive in general are not required.&#13;
Many concepts in this book relate to distributed systems, but you do not need to be familiar with them either.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Reactive systems often rely on message brokers such as Apache Kafka or Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).&#13;
This book introduces the basic knowledge you need to understand how such brokers help in designing and implementing reactive systems.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Three distinct groups can benefit from this book:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Developers who are building cloud native applications or distributed systems</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Architects seeking to understand the role of reactive and event-driven &#13;
<span class="keep-together">architectures</span></p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Curious developers who have heard about Reactive and want a better understanding of it</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>With this book, you will start a journey toward understanding, designing, building, and implementing reactive architectures.&#13;
You will not only learn how it helps to build <em>better</em> distributed systems and cloud applications, but also see how you can use reactive patterns to improve existing systems.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="What About Quarkus?" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45358844321600">&#13;
<h1>What About Quarkus?</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Quarkus" data-secondary="about" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358844320160"/>Attentive readers would have noticed the mention of Quarkus in the subtitle of this book.&#13;
But, so far, we haven’t mentioned it.&#13;
<em>Quarkus</em> is a Java stack tailored for the cloud.&#13;
It uses build-time techniques to reduce the amount of memory used by the application and provide a fast startup time.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>But Quarkus is also a reactive stack.&#13;
At its core, a reactive engine enables the creation of concurrent and resilient applications.&#13;
Quarkus also provides all the features you need to build distributed systems that can adapt to fluctuating loads and inevitable failures.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Throughout this book, we use Quarkus to demonstrate the benefits of the reactive approach and introduce various patterns and best practices.&#13;
Don’t panic if you don’t have prior knowledge or experience with it.&#13;
We will accompany you on the journey, guiding you at every step.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book focuses on creating reactive applications and systems that leverage Quarkus capabilities and provides all the knowledge required to build such systems.&#13;
We do not cover the complete Quarkus ecosystem, as this book concentrates on the Quarkus components that help in the construction of reactive systems.</p>&#13;

<h1>Getting You Ready</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Throughout this book, you will see many examples of code.&#13;
These examples illustrate the concepts covered in this book.&#13;
Some are basic and run in an IDE, and others require a couple of prerequisites.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We cover these examples, one by one, throughout this book.&#13;
Now, maybe you’re not one for suspense.&#13;
Or, more likely, maybe you’re already tired of hearing us blather on at length and just want to see this working.&#13;
If that’s the case, simply point your browser to <a href="https://github.com/cescoffier/reactive-systems-in-java"><em class="hyperlink">https://github.com/cescoffier/reactive-systems-in-java</em></a> and feel free to kick the tires a bit.&#13;
You can retrieve the code with Git using <code>git clone https://github.com/cescoffier/reactive-systems-in-java.git</code>.&#13;
Alternatively, you can download a <a href="https://oreil.ly/Ey74z">ZIP file</a> and unzip it.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The code is organized by chapter.&#13;
For example, the code related to <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#quarkus">Chapter 2</a> is available in the <em>chapter-2</em> directory (<a data-type="xref" href="#code-chapter">Table P-1</a>).&#13;
Depending on the chapter, the code may be split into multiple modules.&#13;

<p>The examples from the code repository use Java 11, so be sure to have a suitable Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.&#13;
They also use Apache Maven as the build tool.&#13;
You don’t have to install Maven, as the repository uses the <a href="https://oreil.ly/0oKc9">Maven Wrapper</a> (provisioning Maven automatically).&#13;
<a data-primary="Apache Maven" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358844397200"/><a data-primary="Maven" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358844396496"/>However, if you prefer installing it, download it from the <a href="https://oreil.ly/XgiCr">Apache Maven Project website</a>, and follow the instructions on the <a href="https://oreil.ly/nwJV9">Installing Apache Maven page</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To build the code, run <code>mvn verify</code> from the root of the project.&#13;
Maven is going to download a set of artifacts, so be sure to have an internet connection.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book covers Quarkus, a Kubernetes-native Java stack.&#13;
You don’t need to install anything to use Quarkus, as long as you have Java and Maven.&#13;
It will download everything else automatically.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You will need Docker.&#13;
Docker is used to create containers for our applications.&#13;
<a data-primary="Docker" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358844392192"/>Install Docker by following the instructions <a href="https://oreil.ly/DjBnj">at the Get Docker page</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Finally, several chapters illustrate the deployment of our reactive applications in Kubernetes.&#13;
<a data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="deploying to" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358844390080"/>To deploy to Kubernetes, you first need <code>kubectl</code>, a command-line tool to interact with Kubernetes.&#13;
Install it by following the instructions <a href="https://oreil.ly/4SA4J">from the Kubernetes Install Tools page</a>.&#13;
Unless you have a Kubernetes cluster handy, we also recommend minikube be installed on your machine,&#13;
to provide a Kubernetes environment.&#13;
Follow the instructions at <a href="https://oreil.ly/vuCs1">the minikube website</a> to install it.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Why do we need all these tools?&#13;
You will see in this book that being reactive adds constraints to your application but also to your infrastructure.&#13;
Kubernetes provides the primitives we need to deploy applications, create replicas, and keep our system on track.&#13;
On the other side, Quarkus provides the set of features we need to implement reactive applications, including nonblocking I/O, reactive programming, reactive APIs, and messaging capabilities.&#13;
Quarkus also provides integration with Kubernetes for easing the deployment and configuration of applications.</p>&#13;

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Writing a book is never easy.&#13;
It’s a long and demanding task, taking lots of energy and eating quite a lot of family time.&#13;
Therefore, our first thanks go to our families who supported us during this marathon.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We are also grateful to be working with exceptional people at Red Hat. Countless people helped us during this journey; it’s impossible to cite all of them.&#13;
A special thank you to Georgios Andrianakis, Roberto Cortez, Stuart Douglas, Stéphane Epardaud,  Jason Greene, Sanne Grinovero, Gavin King, Martin Kouba, Julien Ponge, Erin Schnabel, Guillaume Smet, Michal Szynkiewicz, Ladislav Thon, and Julien Viet.&#13;
Their work is not only brilliant, but also breathtaking. It’s a privilege for us to work with such top-notch developers.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Finally, we thank all the reviewers who have provided fantastic and constructive feedback: Mary Grygleski, Adam Bellemare, Antonio Goncalves, Mark Little, Scott Morrison, Nick Keune, and Chris Mayfield.</p>&#13;
