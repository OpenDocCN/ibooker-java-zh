- en: This appendix will help you get up and running with the code examples found
    throughout the book. Some of the steps here were mentioned in [Chapter 2](ch02.html#learnjava6-CHP-2),
    but we want to go through them a little slower here with specific details on how
    to use the book examples inside the free Community Edition of IntelliJ IDEA from
    JetBrains. As noted in [“Installing IntelliJ IDEA and Creating a Project”](ch02.html#learnjava6-CHP-2-SECT-1.2),
    you can get IntelliJ from the [jetbrains.com](https://oreil.ly/Lo9Xk) site. And
    they have an excellent [installation guide](https://oreil.ly/Fh9fV) if you need
    more help setting things up.

    of the JDK selected. (If you still need to install Java itself, [“Installing the
    JDK”](ch02.html#learnjava6-CHP-2-SECT-1.1) has details for each of the major platforms.)
    The File → Project Structure dialog shown in [Figure A-1](#learnjava6-APP-A-FIG-idea-enable-preview)
    allows you to select from any JDKs you have installed. For the purposes of this
    book, you will need at least Java 19\. You will also want to set the “Language
    level” option to the Preview version for your chosen JDK.

    development environment out there. It’s not even the only free one! Microsoft’s
    [VS Code](https://oreil.ly/pv2JX) can be quickly configured to support Java. And
    [Eclipse](https://oreil.ly/zxBL1), maintained by IBM, remains available. Beginners
    looking for a tool designed to ease them into both Java programming and the world
    of Java IDEs can check out [BlueJ](https://oreil.ly/QcZ_I), created by King’s
    College London.

    for the book from GitHub. While we often include complete source listings when
    discussing particular topics, many times we chose to leave out things like `import`
    or `package` statements, or the enclosing `class` structure for brevity and readability.
    The downloadable code examples aim to be complete to help reinforce the discussions
    in the book.

- en: You can visit GitHub in a browser to meander through the individual examples
    without downloading anything. Just head to the [*learnjava6e* repository](https://github.com/l0y/learnjava6e).
    (If that link doesn’t work, just go to [github.com](https://github.com) and search
    for the term “learnjava6e.”) It might be worth poking around GitHub generally
    as it has become the primary watering hole for open source developers and even
    corporate teams. You can look over the history of a repository as well as report
    bugs and discuss issues related to the code.

    code manager, that developers use to manage revisions among teams for code projects.
    But recall from [Figure 2-14](ch02.html#learnjava6-CHP-2-FIG-10) that you don’t
    have to use *git*. You can just grab the whole batch of examples by downloading
    the main branch of the project as a [ZIP archive](https://oreil.ly/HoZrA). Once
    it’s downloaded, just unzip the file into a folder where you can easily find the
    examples. You should see a folder structure similar to [Figure A-2](#learnjava6-APP-A-FIG-1).

- en: If you’re curious about Git but your system does not already have the *git*
    command available, you can download it from the [Git website](https://oreil.ly/YfF4H).
    GitHub has its own site to help you learn about *git* at [try.github.io](http://try.github.io/).
    Once *git* is installed, you can clone the project to a folder on your computer.
    You can work from that clone or keep it as a clean copy of the code examples.
    As a small bonus, if we publish any fixes or updates down the road, you can also
    easily sync your cloned folder.

- en: Before we import anything into IntelliJ IDEA, you may want to rename the folder
    where you downloaded the code examples from GitHub. After cloning or unzipping,
    you likely have a folder named *learnjava6e-main*. That’s a perfectly fine name,
    but if you want something friendlier (or shorter), go ahead and rename the folder
    now. We chose to rename the folder *learnjava6e* (without the *-main* suffix).

    and running the examples. Using the project hierarchy on the left, open the *ch02/examples*
    folder and click on the `HelloJava` class. The source file for our class should
    appear on the right. If you see a pale yellow banner similar to the one shown
    in [Figure A-5](#learnjava6-APP-A-FIG-ide-set-jdk), click on the Setup SDK linked
    text in the upper-right corner. (*SDK* stands for Software Development Kit, and
    in our case, it’s synonymous with JDK.) Pick the JDK you want to use from the
    dialog that appears.

    Setup SDK 链接文本。（*SDK* 意为软件开发工具包，在我们的情况下与 JDK 同义。）从弹出的对话框中选择要使用的 JDK。
