<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book introduces the Java programming language and environment. Whether you are a software developer or just someone who uses the internet in your daily life, you’ve undoubtedly heard about Java. Its arrival was one of the most exciting developments in the history of the web, and Java applications continue to power business on the internet. Java is, arguably, the most popular programming language in the world, used by millions of developers on almost every kind of computer imaginable. Java has surpassed languages such as C++ and Visual Basic in terms of developer demand and has become the de facto language for certain kinds of development—especially for web-based services. Most universities are now using Java in their introductory courses alongside the other important modern languages. Perhaps you’re using this text in one of your classes right now!</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book gives you a thorough grounding in Java fundamentals and grammar. <em>Learning Java</em>, Sixth Edition, attempts to live up to its name by mapping out the Java language and its class libraries, programming techniques, and idioms. We’ll dig deep into interesting areas and at least scratch the surface of other popular topics. Other titles from O’Reilly pick up where we leave off and provide more comprehensive information on specific areas and applications of Java.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Whenever possible, we provide compelling, realistic, and fun examples and avoid merely cataloging features. The examples are simple but hint at what can be done. We won’t be developing the next great “killer app” in these pages, but we hope to give you a starting point for many hours of experimentation and inspired tinkering that will lead you to develop one yourself.</p>&#13;

<h1>Who Should Read This Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book is for computer professionals, students, technical people, and Finnish hackers. It’s for everyone who has a need for hands-on experience using Java with an eye toward building real applications. This book could also be considered a crash course in object-oriented programming, threads, and user interfaces. As you learn about Java, you’ll also learn a powerful and practical approach to software development, beginning with a deep understanding of the fundamentals of Java.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Superficially, Java looks like C or C++, so you’ll have a tiny head start in using this book if you have some experience with one of these languages. If you do not, don’t worry. In many respects, Java acts like more dynamic languages such as Smalltalk and Lisp. Knowledge of another object-oriented programming language will certainly help, although you may have to change some ideas and unlearn a few habits. Java is considerably simpler than languages such as C++ and Smalltalk. If you learn well from concise examples and personal experimentation, you’ll like this book.</p>&#13;

<h1>New Developments</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We cover all of the important features of the latest “long-term support” release of Java, officially called Java Standard Edition (SE) 21, OpenJDK 21. Sun Microsystems (Java’s keeper before Oracle) has changed the naming scheme many times over the years. Sun coined the term <em>Java 2</em> to cover the major new features introduced in Java version 1.2 and dropped the term <em>JDK</em> in favor of <em>SDK</em>. With the sixth release, Sun skipped from Java version 1.4 to Java 5.0 but revived the term JDK and kept its numbering convention. After that, we had Java 6, Java 7, and Java 8. Starting with Java 9, Oracle announced a regular (an expedited) release cadence. New versions are released twice a year, and we are at Java 21 as we write in 2023.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This release of Java reflects a mature language with occasional syntactic changes and updates to packages and libraries. We’ve tried to capture these new features and update every example in this book to reflect the current Java style and best practices.</p>&#13;

</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you’re like us, you don’t read books from front to back. If you’re really like us, you usually don’t read the preface at all. However, on the off chance that you will see this in time, here are a few suggestions:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>If you are already a programmer and just need to learn Java in the next five minutes, you are probably looking for the examples. You might want to start by glancing at the tutorial in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#learnjava6-CHP-2">Chapter 2</a>. If that doesn’t float your boat, you should at least look at the information in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#learnjava6-CHP-3">Chapter 3</a>, which explains how to use the compiler and interpreter. This should get you started.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch12.html#learnjava6-CHP-12">Chapter 12</a> discusses Java’s graphics features and component architecture. You should read this if you are interested in writing desktop graphical Java <span class="keep-together">applications.</span></p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch13.html#learnjava6-CHP-13">Chapter 13</a> is the place to head if you are interested in writing network applications or interacting with web-based services. Networking remains one of the more interesting and important parts of Java.</p>&#13;

<h1>Online Resources</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There are many <a data-primary="Java" data-secondary="online resources" data-type="indexterm" id="id588"/>online sources for information about Java.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Look at <a href="https://oreil.ly/Lo8QZ">Oracle’s official website</a> for Java topics such as the software, updates, and Java releases. This is where you’ll find the reference implementation of the JDK, which includes the compiler, the interpreter, and other tools.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Oracle also maintains the <a href="https://oreil.ly/DrTm4">OpenJDK site</a>. This is the primary open source version of Java and the associated tools. We’ll be using the OpenJDK for all the examples in this book.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You should also visit <a href="http://oreilly.com">O’Reilly’s site</a>. There you’ll find information about other O’Reilly books for both Java and a growing array of other topics. You should also check out the online learning and conference options—O’Reilly is a real champion for education in all its forms.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>And of course, you can check the home page for <a href="https://oreil.ly/learning-java-6e"><em>Learning Java</em></a>!</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Conventions Used in This Book" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="learnjava6-PREFACE-2-SECT-4">&#13;
<h1>Conventions Used in This Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The font conventions used in this book are quite simple.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>Italic</em> is used for:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Pathnames, filenames, and program names</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Internet addresses, such as domain names and URLs</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>New terms where they are defined</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Program names, compilers, interpreters, utilities, and commands</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Emphasis on important points</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p><code>Constant width</code> is used for:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Anything that might appear in a Java program, including method names, variable names, and class names</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Tags that might appear in an HTML or XML document</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Keywords, objects, and environment variables</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="less_space pagebreak-before"><strong><code>Constant width bold</code></strong> is used for:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Text that is typed by the user on the command line or in a dialog</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em><code>Constant width italic</code></em> is used for:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Replaceable items in code</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>&#13;
<p>This element signifies a tip or suggestion.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>This element signifies a general note.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p>This element indicates a warning or caution.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In the main body of text, we always use a pair of empty parentheses after a method name to distinguish methods from variables, classes, and other creatures.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In the Java source listings, we follow the coding conventions most frequently used in the Java community. Class names begin with capital letters; variable and method names begin with lowercase. All the letters in the names of constants are capitalized. We don’t use underscores to separate words in a long name; following common practice, we capitalize individual words (after the first) and run the words together. For example: <code>thisIsAVariable</code>, <code>thisIsAMethod()</code>, <code>ThisIsAClass</code>, and &#13;
<span class="keep-together"><code>THIS_IS_A_CONSTANT</code></span>. Also note that we differentiate between static and nonstatic methods when we refer to them. Unlike some books, we never write <code>Foo.bar()</code> to mean the <code>bar()</code> method of <code>Foo</code> unless <code>bar()</code> is a static method (paralleling the Java syntax in that case).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For source listings from example programs, the listing will begin with a comment indicating the related filename (and method name, if needed):</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre class="less_space pagebreak-before" data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting"><code class="c1">// filename: ch02/examples/HelloWorld.java</code><code class="w"/>&#13;
&#13;
<code class="w">  </code><code class="kd">public</code><code class="w"> </code><code class="kd">static</code><code class="w"> </code><code class="kt">void</code><code class="w"> </code><code class="nf">main</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="n">String</code><code class="w"> </code><code class="n">args</code><code class="o">[]</code><code class="p">)</code><code class="w"> </code><code class="p">{</code><code class="w"/>&#13;
<code class="w">    </code><code class="n">System</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="na">out</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="na">println</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s">"Hello, world!"</code><code class="p">);</code><code class="w"/>&#13;
<code class="w">  </code><code class="p">}</code><code class="w"/></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You should feel free to look at the noted file in your editor or IDE. We encourage you to compile and run the examples. And we especially encourage tinkering!</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For work in <em>jshell</em>, we will always retain the <code>jshell</code> prompt:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre class="jshell" data-type="programlisting">jshell&gt; System.out.println("Hello, jshell!")&#13;
Hello, jshell!</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Other snippets without a filename or <em>jshell</em> prompt are meant to illustrate valid syntax and structure, or to present a hypothetical approach to handling a programming task. These undecorated listings are not necessarily meant to be executed, although you are always encouraged to create your own classes for trying out any topic in the book.</p>&#13;

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Many people have contributed to putting this book together, both in its <em>Exploring Java</em> incarnation and in its current form as <em>Learning Java</em>. Foremost, we would like to thank Brian Guerin, Senior Acquisitions Editor, and Zan McQuade, Content Director, for kicking off this edition. Indeed, we want to thank the entire team at O’Reilly, including Sarah Grey, Development Editor; Ashley Stussy, Production Editor; and Kristen Brown, Manager, Content Services. It’s hard to imagine a company more dedicated to the success of their employees, authors, and readers. Sarah deserves a particularly loud shoutout for her work editing this sixth edition. Authors often thank their editors regardless of the genre of book, but this gratitude and praise is doubly important for technical topics. Sarah is a tireless collaborator who lifted our moods almost as regularly as she improved the quality of our writing.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Several reviewers provided valuable feedback as we prepared this edition. Duncan MacGregor directed several topics down more useful paths. Eric van Hoose tightened our prose. David Calabrese noted spots where new programmers might need more background. And Alex Faber helped validate the code for all of our examples and exercises. As with so many things, extra eyes are indispensable. We are lucky to have had such attentive pairs in our corner.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The original version of the glossary came from David Flanagan’s book <a href="http://oreil.ly/Java_Nutshell_5"><em>Java in a Nutshell</em></a> (O’Reilly). We also borrowed several class hierarchy diagrams from David’s book. These diagrams were based on similar diagrams by Charles L. Perkins.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Finally, warm thanks to Ron Becker for sound advice and interesting ideas as seen from the perspective of a layman well removed from the programming world.</p>&#13;
