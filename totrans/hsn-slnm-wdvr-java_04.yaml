- en: Selenium WebDriver is an open source library that allows controlling web browsers
    (e.g., Chrome, Edge, or Firefox, to name a few) programmatically as a real user
    would do. It provides a cross-browser API that you can use to implement end-to-end
    tests for web applications. This part of the book presents an in-depth summary
    of the Selenium WebDriver API. The following chapters aim to be very practical.
    For this reason, I explain each feature of the Selenium WebDriver API using ready-to-use
    tests available on the examples repository in GitHub.
