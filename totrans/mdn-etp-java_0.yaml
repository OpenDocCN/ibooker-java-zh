- en: 'We both want to thank Jason “Jay” Dobies for his wild passion for getting through
    our German/Italian English. He not only helped us to be better writers but also
    gave valuable insight as an early reader. Thank you for having been part of this
    journey. Everybody says writing a book isn’t easy. We did know that before we
    started. What we bluntly underestimated was the fact that we started writing at
    the beginning of a pandemic. We both went through more ups and downs than expected,
    and it is only because of our families and friends that we even got an opportunity
    to finish this book. We also can’t praise the O’Reilly team enough for their patience,
    flexible deadlines, and open ears when we needed them. Thank you, Suzanne McQuade,
    Nicole Taché, and Amelia Blevins! Thank you, Red Hat. For providing an amazing
    place to work, learn, and grow. We love open source and sharing knowledge as much
    as probably everybody else in this company. To the many “Hatters” for their support
    on the way! Technical reviewers catch you at your weakest. Whenever we tried to
    sneak a little detail by them, they found it and asked the right questions. Thank
    you all for your dedication and inspirations along the way: Sébastien Blanc, Alex
    Soto, and Marc Hildenbrand! The heart of this book is not only the combined experience
    accumulated by us but first and foremost an example. This example was initialy
    created by Madou Coulibaly and Alex Groom. They used this to teach many developers
    how to effectivly build cloud native applications and allowed us to use their
    consise example as the base. #stayHealthy #wearAMask #protectYourLovedOnes'
