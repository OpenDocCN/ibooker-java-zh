  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mastering software development involves learning a disparate set of concepts.
    If you’re starting out as a junior software developer, or even if you’re more
    experienced, it can seem like an insurmountable hurdle. Should you be spending
    time learning about established topics in the object-oriented world such as SOLID
    principles, design patterns, or test-driven development? Should you be trying
    out things that are becoming increasingly popular such as functional programming?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even once you’ve picked some topics to learn it’s often hard to identify how
    they fit together. When you should go down the route of applying functional programming
    ideas in your project? When do you worry about testing? How do you know at what
    point to introduce or refine these techniques? Do you need to read a book on each
    of these topics and then another set of blog posts or videos to explain how to
    put things together? Where do you even start?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don’t worry, this book is here to help you. You will be helped through an integrated,
    project-driven approach to learning. You’ll learn the core topics that you need
    to know in order to become a productive developer. Not only that, but we show
    how these things fit together into bigger projects.

- en: Why We Wrote This Book
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over the years we have built up a wealth of experience around teaching developers
    to code. We have both written books on Java 8 onward and run training courses
    around professional software development. In the process we’ve been recognized
    as Java Champions and international conference speakers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ve found over the years that many developers could benefit from either an
    introduction or a refresher on several core topics. Design patterns, functional
    programming, SOLID principles, and testing are practices that often get good coverage
    in their own right, but it’s rarely shown how they work well and fit together.
    People sometimes even get put off from improving their skills simply due to the
    paralysis of choice over what to learn. We want to not only teach people core
    skills, but do so in a way that’s easy to approach and fun, too.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book also gives you the opportunity to learn in a developer-oriented way.
    It contains plenty of code samples and whenever we introduce a topic we always
    provide concrete code examples. You get all the code for the projects within the
    book, so if you want to follow along you can even step through the book code in
    an *Integrated Development Environment* (IDE) or run the programs in order to
    try them out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another common bugbear when it comes to technical books is that they are often
    written in a formal, lecturing style. That’s not how normal people speak to each
    other! In this book you’ll get a conversational style that helps to engage you
    in the content rather than being patronizing.

- en: What’s in the Book?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each chapter is structured around a software project. At the end of a chapter,
    if you’ve been following along, you should be able to write that project. The
    projects start off as simple command-line batch programs but grow in complexity
    to fully fledged applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll benefit from a project-driven structure in a variety of ways. First,
    you get to see how different programming techniques work together in an integrated
    setting. When we look at functional programming toward the end of the book, it
    isn’t just abstract collection-processing operations—they’re presented in order
    to calculate actual results used by the project in question. This solves the problem
    of educational material showing good ideas or approaches, but developers often
    use them inappropriately or out of context.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, a project-driven approach helps ensure that at each stage you see realistic
    examples. Educational materials are often full of example classes called `Foo`
    and methods called `bar`. Our examples are relevant to the projects in question
    and show how to apply the ideas to real problems, similar to the ones that you
    may encounter in your career.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, it’s more fun and engaging to learn this way. Each chapter is a fresh
    project and a fresh opportunity to learn new things. We want you to read through
    to the end and really enjoy turning the pages as you’re reading. The chapters
    start with a challenge that will be solved, walk you through the solution, and
    then end by evaluating what you learned and how the challenge was solved. We specifically
    call out the challenge at the beginning and end of every chapter to ensure that
    its goals are clear to you.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’re confident that developers from a wide variety of backgrounds will find
    things that are useful and interesting in this book. Having said that, there are
    some people who will get the maximum value out of this book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Junior software developers, often just out of university or a couple of years
    into their programming career, are who we think of as the core audience for this
    book. You’ll learn about fundamental topics that we expect to be of relevance
    throughout your software development career. You don’t need to have a university
    degree by any means, but you do need to know the basics of programming in order
    to make the best use of this book. We won’t explain what an if statement or a
    loop is, for example.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You don’t need to know much about object-oriented or functional programming
    in order to get started. In [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#chapter_02), we make no assumptions
    beyond that you know what a class is and can use collections with generics (e.g.,
    `List<String>`). We take it right from the basics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another group who will find this book of particular interest is developers learning
    Java while coming from another programming language, such as C#, C++, or Python.
    This book helps you quickly get up to speed with the language constructs and also
    the principles, practices, and idioms that are important to write good Java code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re a more experienced Java developer, you may want to skip [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#chapter_02)
    in order to avoid repeating basic material that you already know, but [Chapter 3](ch03.xhtml#chapter_03)
    onward will be full of concepts and approaches that will be of benefit to many
    developers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ve found that learning can be one of the most fun parts of software development
    and hope that you’ll find that as well when reading this book. We hope you have
    fun on this journey.
