- en: This last part covers different aspects and use cases built on top of the Selenium
    WebDriver API. First, you will learn about the Page Object Model (POM), a widely
    used design pattern that allows the development of reusable and maintainable WebDriver
    tests. The following chapter explains different techniques for robust cross-browser
    testing, such as parameterized tests, test order, or parallel text execution.
    The next chapter describes how to use third-party libraries and frameworks in
    conjunction with Selenium WebDriver, such as Cucumber or the Spring Framework,
    among others. The final chapter summarizes various libraries complementary to
    Selenium WebDriver, such as Appium or REST Assured. To conclude, you will discover
    the main features of the current alternatives of Selenium, such as Cypress, WebDriverIO,
    TestCafe, Puppeteer, and Playwright.
