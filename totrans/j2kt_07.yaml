- en: As an industry, we have invented a lot of phrases to describe callable subprograms
    within a larger program. We have the very generic *subroutine*. Some languages
    (notably Pascal) distinguish between *functions* that return a result, and *procedures*,
    which don’t; but most developers use the terms interchangeably. Then there are
    *methods*, which are subroutines associated with an object (or a class, in the
    case of static methods).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The C language calls them all functions but has a special `void` type to represent
    the absence of a return value. This was carried forward into Java. Kotlin uses
    `Unit` in almost the same way, except that `Unit` is not the absence of a return
    value, but rather a singleton value that is returned instead.

    of our software. We define them with some sort of notation, generally the programming
    language we are using. They are also generally fixed during a run of the program;
    in static languages, at least, we don’t usually redefine functions on the fly.

    invocations of a function.'

    we can safely cache its result; if it is inexpensive, we can safely recalculate
    it on demand if that simplifies things. It is this feeling of safety that puts
    the smug smile on the faces of functional programmers (well, that and knowing
    that a monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors). Those functional
    programmers also have a term for the property of a function that makes it a calculation:

    our software needs to have an effect on the world, which is an action. There is
    no overlap though; code can’t be an action and a calculation, both timeless and
    time-dependent. If we take some code that is a calculation and have it invoke
    an action, then it becomes an action, because it will now depend on when or whether
    it is called. We can think of calculations as the purer code, where code inherits
    the most tainted level of all of its dependencies. We see the same thing with
    susceptibility to errors in [Chapter 19](ch19.html#throwing-to-returning). If
    we value purity (which in all these cases brings ease of reasoning and refactoring),
    we must strive to pull the boundary between impure and pure code to the outer
    layers of our system—those closest to the entry points. If we succeed, then a
    significant proportion of our code can be calculations and, hence, easily tested,
    reasoned with, and refactored.

- en: Looking through our code, we find (scream) that we don’t have any unit tests
    for the handler. If we want to add them, this is the level at which we would now
    inject a `Clock`, rather than into the individual services. Mocks or stubs allow
    us to test actions, but are rarely required to test calculations.

- en: We won’t show it, but we also have to consider the production implementation
    of `Trips`, the one that reads from our database. We are lucky and find that this
    passes the current time into its SQL query, so now we can just use the value of
    the `at` parameter in `Trips.currentTripsFor(String customerId, Instant at)` instead.
    It would have been more complicated if the SQL query was using the current time
    of the database server from a database-specific expression such as `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
    or `NOW`. As with non-SQL code, actions are so pervasive that this is a common
    practice even though it makes testing more complicated and the code itself less
    versatile. If our query had used the database time, we would have to rewrite it
    to receive the time from our function as a parameter, and make a mental note not
    to make the same mistake again.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is significant. This way of thinking about calculations and actions doesn’t
    depend on our implementation language, and the grain of Java is becoming more
    functional with time. We find, though, that Kotlin’s more natural support for
    immutable data and other functional constructs means that the costs of making
    the distinction are lower, and so the cost/benefit ratio looks more favorable.
    Note also that a lot of the refactoring steps taken in this chapter (and others)
    are safe only because we are moving around the invocation of calculations and
    not actions.

- en: That `MutableMap` of `MutableSet`s is a sign that something can change over
    time. If they have the same customer, the result of `tripsFor` will be different
    after we have called `addTrip`. So `tripsFor` is an action, not a calculation.
    If `tripsFor` is an action, then anything that calls it is an action, including
    our `currentTripsFor`. The same will obviously be true of the production version
    of `Trips` that reads and writes to the database. After all this work, we haven’t
    actually promoted our action to a calculation after all!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Should we be downhearted? No. Despite our previous assertion that functions
    are either calculations *or* actions, the truth is that in practice actionness
    is graduated, and actions can be more or less susceptible to time. In this case,
    unless other code *in this interaction* is also going to fetch the trips for a
    customer and find an inconsistency, we can treat `Trips` as effectively immutable.
    So `tripsFor`, and by extension `currentTripsFor`, are effectively calculations.
    In this respect our `InMemoryTrips` is less safe than our database implementation
    because, if accessed on multiple threads, it can mutate the collection returned
    by `tripsFor`, leading to potential `ConcurrentModification​Excep⁠tions` in the
    `filter` implementation. Categorizing our code into calculations and actions has
    helped us see these issues and given us a framework for deciding whether they
    are important in context.

- en: Lastly, note that Kotlin’s preference for immutable data makes this categorization
    easier. For example, when you see `List` in Java, you have to find the places
    in which it is created or referenced to establish its mutability and, hence, the
    likelihood that code accessing it can be an action. In Kotlin, when you see `MutableList`
    you can infer an action, although as we have seen with `InMemoryTrips`, exposing
    a mutable collection with a read-only alias can lead to actions pretending to
    be calculations.
