<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>This book is a desktop Java reference, designed to sit faithfully by your keyboard while you program.
<a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="part-num-title" href="part01.xhtml#javanut-PART-1">Part I, “Introducing Java”</a> is a fast-paced, “no-fluff” introduction to the Java programming language and the core runtime aspects of the Java platform.
<a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="part-num-title" href="part02.xhtml#javanut-PART-2">Part II, “Working with the Java Platform”</a> is a reference section that blends elucidation of core concepts with examples of important core APIs.
The book covers Java 17, but we recognize that some shops may not have adopted it yet—so where possible we call out if a feature was introduced after Java 8.
We use Java 17 syntax throughout, including <code>var</code> and lambda <span class="keep-together">expressions</span>.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Changes in the Eighth Edition" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45927773683040">
<h1>Changes in the Eighth Edition</h1>
<p><a data-primary="Java 17" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45927773681488"/>The seventh edition of this book covers Java 11, whereas this edition covers Java 17.
However, the release process of Java changed significantly with the arrival of Java 9, and certain releases of Java are now badged as <em>long-term support</em> (LTS) releases.
So, Java 17 is the next LTS release of Java after Java 11.</p>
<p>With the eighth edition we have tried to update the concept of what it means to be a “Nutshell” guide.
The modern Java developer needs to know more than just syntax and APIs.
As the Java environment has matured, such topics as concurrency, object-oriented design, memory, and the Java type system have all grown in importance for all developers.</p>
<p>In this edition, we have taken the approach that only the most recent versions of Java are likely to be of interest to the majority of Java developers, so we usually only call out when new features arrived after Java 8.</p>
<p>For example, the module system (that arrived with Java 9) is still likely to be new for at least some developers, and it represents a major change.
However, it is also something of an advanced topic and is in someways separate from the rest of the language, so we have restricted our treatment of it to a single chapter.</p>

<h1>Contents of This Book</h1>
<p>The first six chapters document the Java language and the
Java platform—they should all be considered essential reading. The book
is biased toward the Oracle/OpenJDK (Open Java Development Kit)
implementation of Java but not greatly so. Developers working with other
Java environments will still find plenty to occupy them.
<a data-type="xref" href="part01.xhtml#javanut-PART-1">Part I</a> includes:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch01.xhtml#javanut8-CHP-1">Chapter 1, “Introduction to the Java Environment”</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This chapter is an overview of the Java language and the Java
platform. It explains the important features and benefits of Java,
including the lifecycle of a Java program. We also touch on Java
security and answer some criticisms of Java.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch02.xhtml#javanut8-CHP-2">Chapter 2, “Java Syntax from the Ground Up”</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This chapter explains the details of the Java programming language,
including the Java 8 language changes. It is a long and detailed
chapter that does not assume substantial programming experience.
Experienced Java programmers can use it as a language reference.
Programmers with substantial experience with languages such as C and
C++ should be able to pick up Java syntax quickly by reading this
chapter; beginning programmers with only a modest amount of experience
should be able to learn Java programming by studying this chapter
carefully, although it is best read in conjunction with an introductory text
(such as O’Reilly’s <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://oreil.ly/hf_Java_3e"><em class="hyperlink">Head First
Java</em></a> by Kathy Sierra, Bert Bates, and Trisha Gee).</p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch03.xhtml#javanut8-CHP-3">Chapter 3, “Object-Oriented Programming <span class="keep-together">in Java</span>”</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This chapter describes how the basic Java syntax documented in
<a data-type="xref" href="ch02.xhtml#javanut8-CHP-2">Chapter 2</a> is used to write simple
object-oriented programs using classes and objects in Java. The
chapter assumes no prior experience with object-oriented programming. It can be
used as a tutorial by new programmers or as a reference by experienced
Java programmers.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch04.xhtml#javanut8-CHP-4">Chapter 4, “The Java Type System”</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This chapter builds on the basic description of object-oriented
programming in Java and introduces the other aspects of Java’s type
system, such as generic types, enumerated types, and annotations. With
this more complete picture, we can discuss the biggest change in Java
8—the arrival of lambda expressions.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch05.xhtml#javanut8-CHP-5">Chapter 5, “Introduction to Object-Oriented Design in Java”</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This chapter is an overview of some basic techniques used in the
design of sound object-oriented programs, and it briefly touches on the
topic of design patterns and their use in software engineering.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch06.xhtml#javanut8-CHP-6">Chapter 6, “Java’s Approach to Memory <span class="keep-together">and Concurrency</span>”</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This chapter explains how the Java Virtual Machine manages memory on
behalf of the programmer, and how memory and visibility are intimately
entwined with Java’s support for concurrent programming and threads.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These first six chapters teach you the Java language and get you up and
running with the most important concepts of the Java platform. <a data-type="xref" href="part02.xhtml#javanut-PART-2">Part II</a> is all about how to get real programming work
done in the Java environment. It contains plenty of examples and is
designed to complement the cookbook approach found in some other texts.
This part includes:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch07.xhtml#javanut8-CHP-7">Chapter 7, “Programming and Documentation Conventions”</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This chapter documents important and widely adopted Java programming
conventions. It also explains how you can make your Java code
self-documenting by including specially formatted documentation
comments.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch08.xhtml#javanut8-CHP-8">Chapter 8, “Working with Java Collections”</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This chapter introduces Java’s standard collections libraries. These
contain data structures that are vital to the functioning of virtually
every Java program—such as <code>List</code>, <code>Map</code>, and <code>Set</code>. The new <code>Stream</code>
abstraction and the relationship between lambda expressions and the
collections are explained in detail.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch09.xhtml#javanut8-CHP-9">Chapter 9, “Handling Common Data Formats”</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This chapter discusses how to use Java to work effectively with very
common data formats, such as text, numbers, and temporal (date and
time) information.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch10.xhtml#javanut8-CHP-10">Chapter 10, “File Handling and I/O”</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This chapter covers several different approaches to file access—from
the more classic approach found in older versions of Java, to
more modern and even asynchronous styles. The chapter concludes with a
short introduction to networking with the core Java platform APIs.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch11.xhtml#javanut8-CHP-11">Chapter 11, “Classloading, Reflection, and Method Handles”</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This chapter introduces the subtle art of metaprogramming in
Java—first introducing the concept of metadata about Java types, then
turning to the subject of classloading and how Java’s security model
is linked to the dynamic loading of types. The chapter concludes with
some applications of classloading and the relatively new feature of
method handles.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch12.xhtml#javanut8-CHP-12">Chapter 12, “Java Platform Modules”</a></dt>

<p>This chapter describes Java Platform Module System (JPMS), the major feature that
was introduced as part of Java 9, and provides an introduction to the wide-ranging changes that it brings.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch13.xhtml#javanut8-CHP-13">Chapter 13, “Platform Tools”</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Oracle’s JDK (as well as OpenJDK) includes a number of useful Java
development tools, most notably the Java interpreter and the Java
compiler. This chapter documents those tools, as well as the <code>jshell</code> interactive environment and new tools for working with modular Java.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="app01.xhtml#javanut8-APP-A">Appendix</a></dt>
