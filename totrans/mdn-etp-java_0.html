<h1>Preface</h1>


<p>We wrote this book for developers who are looking to bring their monolithic, Java-based models successfully into the future. The roadmap for the book is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch01.xhtml#revisiting_enterprise_development">Chapter 1</a> presents the fundamental technologies and concepts we will use throughout the book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch02.xhtml#changing_technologies">Chapter 2</a> walks you through a complete microservices-based architecture implementation, using different Java frameworks for different components. We’ll give an overview on how to split the typical monolithic approach into a more diverse and heterogeneous environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch03.xhtml#travel_light_on_your_pathway">Chapter 3</a> presents some basic migration strategies and shows you an evaluation path for the target development platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch04.xhtml#kubernetes_based_softw_dev_platform">Chapter 4</a> discusses how Java developers can benefit from Kubernetes capabilities to modernize and enhance their apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch05.xhtml#beyond_lift_and_shift">Chapter 5</a> explores proven patterns, standardized tools, and open source resources that will help you create long-lasting systems that can grow and change with your needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch06.xhtml#microservices_architecture">Chapter 6</a> demonstrates essential tasks in Kubernetes, such as logging, monitoring, and debugging apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch07.xhtml#serverless_architecture">Chapter 7</a> analyzes how Java developers can create modern applications following a serverless execution model. We outlined some of the most common use cases and architectures that Java developers are likely to work with today and tomorrow.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
<!--Fill in...-->
We both want to thank Jason “Jay” Dobies for his wild passion for getting through our German/Italian English. He not only helped us to be better writers but also gave valuable insight as an early reader. Thank you for having been part of this journey.

Everybody says writing a book isn’t easy. We did know that before we started. What we bluntly underestimated was the fact that we started writing at the beginning of a pandemic. We both went through more ups and downs than expected, and it is only because of our families and friends that we even got an opportunity to finish this book. We also can’t praise the O’Reilly team enough for their patience, flexible deadlines, and open ears when we needed them. Thank you, Suzanne McQuade, Nicole Taché, and Amelia Blevins!

Thank you, Red Hat. For providing an amazing place to work, learn, and grow. We love open source and sharing knowledge as much as probably everybody else in this company. To the many “Hatters” for their support on the way!

Technical reviewers catch you at your weakest. Whenever we tried to sneak a little detail by them, they found it and asked the right questions. Thank you all for your dedication and inspirations along the way: Sébastien Blanc, Alex Soto, and Marc Hildenbrand!

The heart of this book is not only the combined experience accumulated by us but first and foremost an example. This example was initialy created by Madou Coulibaly and Alex Groom. They used this to teach many developers how to effectivly build cloud native applications and allowed us to use their consise example as the base.
