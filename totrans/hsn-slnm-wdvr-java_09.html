<p>This last part covers different aspects and use cases built on top of the Selenium WebDriver API. First, you will learn about the Page Object Model (POM), a widely used design pattern that allows the development of reusable and maintainable WebDriver tests. The following chapter explains different techniques for robust cross-browser testing, such as parameterized tests, test order, or parallel text execution. The next chapter describes how to use third-party libraries and frameworks in conjunction with Selenium WebDriver, such as  Cucumber or the Spring Framework, among others. The final chapter summarizes various libraries complementary to Selenium WebDriver, such as Appium or REST Assured. To conclude, you will discover the main features of the current alternatives of Selenium, such as Cypress, WebDriverIO, TestCafe, Puppeteer, and Playwright.</p>&#13;
