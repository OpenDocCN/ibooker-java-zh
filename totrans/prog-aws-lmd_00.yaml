- en: Serverless computing is a revolutionary way of building systems. At its heart,
    serverless is about performing the minimum technical work necessary to sustainably
    provide value to our users. A serverless approach does this by making the most
    of services provided by cloud vendors, like Amazon Web Services (AWS).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, you’ll learn how to architect, build, and operate serverless applications
    that use *AWS Lambda*—the original, and widely adopted, serverless compute platform.
    AWS Lambda is rarely used by itself, however, and so while reading this book,
    you’ll also learn how to successfully integrate Lambda with other serverless AWS
    services, like S3, DynamoDB, and more.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have been using Lambda since 2015, ever since Lambda’s support for Java was
    first announced. Within just a few weeks we saw the amazing ability that Lambda
    had to let teams build new features far faster than we’d ever seen before. By
    removing a lot of low-level aspects of developing and running systems, and instead
    focusing on a clean, event-driven approach, we realized that many of the complexities
    that got in the way of our teams no longer applied when using Lambda. Lambda also
    let us amplify our use of the rest of the AWS platform—it had a multiplicative
    impact on our effectiveness.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We initially had two concerns about Lambda—that it wouldn’t support the programming
    knowledge and software inventory that we’d built over the years in Java and that
    it would be far too expensive to run at scale.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What we found instead surprised us.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lambda’s support for Java was not merely an “add on.” In fact, Java is a first-class
    runtime within the Lambda platform. Building Lambda applications in Java freed
    us to get back to the essence of programming, letting us use our skills and existing
    code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Further, Lambda turned out to be less, not more, expensive to run than equivalent,
    traditionally built systems. The efficiency of Lambda’s “pay-per-use” model, to
    sub-second precision, allowed us to create systems that processed hundreds of
    millions of events per day and yet were cheaper than their predecessors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This combination of speed of development, embrace of existing languages, and
    cost effectiveness led us to believe that serverless compute platforms, with Lambda
    at their forefront, were the start of something special in our industry. In 2016
    we started our business, Symphonia, with the mission to help companies make the
    leap to this new way of building systems.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is intended primarily for software developers and software architects,
    but it will be useful to anyone involved in the technical aspects of building
    software applications in the cloud.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We assume that you already know or can learn the basics of the Java programming
    language. You don’t need to have knowledge of, or experience with, any Java application
    frameworks (like Spring) or libraries (like Guava). We do not assume that you
    have any prior knowledge of Amazon Web Services.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In many ways serverless, and Lambda with it, is one of the most significant
    changes to building server-side software in decades. While our code may look similar
    line by line, and perhaps even class by class, to how it was written before, the
    architectural constraints and capabilities of Lambda drive designs that have a
    very different shape than what you’ve seen in the past.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over the last few years we’ve come to understand how to successfully build systems
    with Lambda. This book will give you a jump-start into learning these same lessons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From getting started techniques to advanced architecture, from programming and
    testing to deployment and monitoring, we cover the lifecycle of what you need
    to understand to build production-quality systems with Lambda at scale.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What makes this book unique is we do all of this in the context of the Java
    programming language. We’ve both been Java programmers for more than two decades
    each, so in this book we help you use your existing Java skills in a whole new
    way.

- en: Using the End-of-Chapter Exercises
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each chapter of this book ends with some exercises. Some of these exercises
    encourage you to take the lessons of the chapter and see them working “for real”
    in the AWS Cloud. While certain elements of Lambda can be simulated locally, you’ll
    only really get a feel for what Lambda development is like by using it in the
    context of the AWS platform. The good news is that AWS provides a healthy [“free
    tier”](https://aws.amazon.com/free) that should allow you to experiment without
    incurring any costs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other exercises are intended to make you consider how you might work differently
    with Lambda compared with other technologies. Serverless architecture is often
    a very different way of thinking, and working through these exercises will start
    adapting your brain in this way.

    book for you: Brian Gruber, Daniel Bryant, Sarah Wells, and Stuart Sierra. Thanks
    to our former coworkers at Intent Media who joined in with using a wild new technology
    four years ago and showed us how it could transform teams. Thanks to all of Symphonia’s
    clients, partners, and friends—we’re grateful for your continued trust and confidence.
    Thanks to everyone at O’Reilly, especially our editorial team; it’s amazing to
    write our own “animal” book two decades and more after we started reading them.
    And thanks to all of the folk in the serverless community who we’ve been sharing
    this ride with!'

    Chris Munns, Noel Dowling, and Salman Paracha, for producing a revolutionary product

    for leading Lambda through its infancy and for writing the foreword to this book!

    and business partner, Mike, without whom this book and our company would have

    especially from my time at ThoughtWorks. Daniel Terhorst-North has been a mentor
