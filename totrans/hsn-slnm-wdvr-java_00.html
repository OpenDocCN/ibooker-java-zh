&#13;
&#13;
<p>Selenium is an <a data-primary="Selenium" data-secondary="about" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45849762591520"/>open source umbrella project that enables the automation of web browsers. The core component of the Selenium project is Selenium WebDriver, a library for controlling browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, or Opera) programmatically. Selenium WebDriver provides a cross-browser Application Programming Interface (API) in several programming languages (officially supported in Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, or Ruby).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Although we can use Selenium WebDriver for multiple purposes related to browser automation, its primary use is implementing end-to-end tests for web application verification. Thousands of organizations and testers now use Selenium worldwide, and it is one of the leading solutions for end-to-end testing, supporting a multi-million-dollar industry.</p>&#13;

<h1>Who Should Read This Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book provides a comprehensive summary of the main features of Selenium WebDriver version 4, using Java as language binding. It reviews the main aspects of automated web navigation, browser manipulation, web element interaction, user impersonation, automated driver management, the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, use of remote and cloud infrastructure, integration with Docker and third-party tools, and much more.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The primary audience of this book includes Java<a data-primary="Java" data-secondary="knowledge of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45849762551744"/> coders of different levels (from beginner to advanced), such as developers, testers, QA engineers, etc. Thus, you need a basic knowledge of the Java language and <a data-primary="object-oriented programming" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45849762550640"/>object-oriented programming. The final goal is to have a comprehensive understanding of the main aspects of Selenium WebDriver to create end-to-end tests in Java using different testing frameworks of your choice (e.g., JUnit or TestNG).</p>&#13;

<h1>Why I Wrote This Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Test automation is a software testing technique that leverages automation tools to control test execution. It allows increased efficiency and effectiveness while ensuring the overall quality of a software system. In this arena, Selenium WebDriver is the de facto standard library to develop end-to-end tests for web applications. This book provides the first complete review of Selenium 4 to date.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The book follows a learn-by-doing approach. To that aim, we review the main features of Selenium WebDriver through ready-to-be-executed test examples. These examples are publicly available in a GitHub open source repository (<a href="https://github.com/bonigarcia/selenium-webdriver-java"><em class="hyperlink">https://github.com/bonigarcia/selenium-webdriver-java</em></a>). For the sake of completeness, this repository contains each test example in different flavors of the embedding testing framework: JUnit 4, JUnit 5 (alone or with Selenium-Jupiter), and TestNG.</p>&#13;

<p><a data-type="xref" href="part01.html#part01">Part I</a> provides technological background on Selenium, test automation, and project setup. This part, more theoretical than practical, is composed of two chapters:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1, “A Primer on Selenium”</a>, presents the core components of the Selenium project (WebDriver, Grid, and IDE) and its ecosystem (i.e., the tools and technologies around Selenium). In addition, this chapter reviews the principles of end-to-end testing related to Selenium.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2, “Preparing for Testing”</a>, explains how to set up a Java project (Maven and Gradle) containing end-to-end tests that use the Selenium WebDriver API. Then, you will learn how to develop your first WebDriver tests using different testing frameworks: JUnit 4, JUnit 5 (alone or in conjunction with Selenium-Jupiter), and TestNG.</p>&#13;

<h2>Part II, The Selenium WebDriver API</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="part02.html#part02">Part II</a> provides practical insight into the Selenium WebDriver API. This part is guided by tests available in the examples repository and includes the following chapters:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3, “WebDriver Fundamentals”</a>, describes the primary aspects of the Selenium WebDriver API for carrying out automated interaction with web applications. Thus, this chapter reviews several strategies for locating and waiting for web elements. In addition, you will discover how to impersonate user actions (i.e., automated interactions using the keyboard and mouse) in a browser.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4, “Browser-Agnostic Features”</a>, reviews those aspects of the Selenium WebDriver API that are interoperable in different browsers. Hence, this chapter shows how to execute JavaScript, create event listeners, manage windows, make screenshots, handle the shadow DOM, manipulate cookies, access the browser history or web storage, or interact with windows, tabs, and iframes, among other elements.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 5, “Browser-Specific Manipulation”</a>, explains those aspects of the Selenium WebDriver API particular to specific browsers. This group of features covers browser capabilities (options, arguments, preferences, etc.), the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP), geolocation functions, basic and web authentication, printing pages to PDF, or the WebDriver BiDi API.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6, “Remote WebDriver”</a>, describes how to use the Selenium WebDriver API to control remote browsers. Then, you will learn how to set up and use Selenium Grid version 4.

<h2>Part III, Advanced Concepts</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="part03.html#part03">Part III</a> focuses on leveraging the Selenium WebDriver API in different ambits and use cases. This part includes the following chapters:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7, “The Page Object Model (POM)”</a>, introduces POM, a popular design pattern used in conjunction with Selenium WebDriver. This pattern allows users to model web pages using object-oriented classes to ease test maintenance and reduce code duplication.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8, “Testing Framework Specifics”</a>, reviews several particular features of the unit testing framework used together with Selenium WebDriver that allow improvements to different aspects of the overall testing process. To that aim, this chapter first explains how to carry out cross-browser testing (i.e., reusing the same test logic for verifying web applications using different browsers) using parameterized tests and test templates. Then, you will learn how to split tests into different categories for execution filtering, ordering tests, failure analysis (i.e., collecting and analyzing data to determine the cause of a failure), retrying tests, parallel test execution, test listeners, or disabling tests.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch09.html#ch09">Chapter 9, “Third-Party Integrations”</a>, reviews different technologies you can use to enhance your Selenium WebDriver tests, such as reporting tools, test data generation, and other frameworks (e.g., Cucumber or Spring). Moreover, this chapter describes how to use external libraries with Selenium to implement specific use cases, such as file downloading or nonfunctional tests (such as load, security, or accessibility).</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch10.html#ch10">Chapter 10, “Beyond Selenium”</a>, presents a couple of automation frameworks related to Selenium: Appium (for mobile testing) and REST Assured (for testing REST web services). To conclude, we review some of the most relevant current alternatives to Selenium WebDriver, such as Cypress, WebDriverIO, TestCafe, Puppeteer, or Playwright.</p>&#13;
