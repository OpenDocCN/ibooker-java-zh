<p>This <a data-primary="IDEA (IntelliJ IDEA)" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_idea_intellij2"/><a data-primary="IntelliJ IDEA" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_intellij_idea2"/><a data-primary="Swing API" data-secondary="IntelliJ IDEA" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_swing_api"/><a data-primary="code examples" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_code_ex"/>appendix will help you get up and running with the code examples found throughout the book. Some of the steps here were mentioned in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#learnjava6-CHP-2">Chapter 2</a>, but we want to go through them a little slower here with specific details on how to use the book examples inside the free Community Edition of IntelliJ IDEA from JetBrains. As noted in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#learnjava6-CHP-2-SECT-1.2">“Installing IntelliJ IDEA and Creating a Project”</a>, you can get IntelliJ from the <a href="https://oreil.ly/Lo9Xk">jetbrains.com</a> site. And they have an excellent <a href="https://oreil.ly/Fh9fV">installation guide</a> if you need more help setting things up.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Once you have IDEA installed, you’ll want to make sure you have a recent version of the JDK selected. (If you still need to install Java itself, <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#learnjava6-CHP-2-SECT-1.1">“Installing the JDK”</a> has details for each of the major platforms.) The File → Project Structure dialog shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#learnjava6-APP-A-FIG-idea-enable-preview">Figure A-1</a> allows you to select from any JDKs you have installed. For the purposes of this book, you will need at least Java 19. You will also want to set the “Language level” option to the Preview version for your chosen JDK.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>In this example, we use Corretto 20 and select the 20 (Preview) language level. If you want more information on enabling Java’s preview features in IntelliJ IDEA, check out their&#13;
<a href="https://oreil.ly/jePVu">preview feature tutorial</a> online.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We also want to reiterate that IntelliJ IDEA is not the only Java-friendly integrated development environment out there. It’s not even the only free one! Microsoft’s <a href="https://oreil.ly/pv2JX">VS Code</a> can be quickly configured to support Java. And <a href="https://oreil.ly/zxBL1">Eclipse</a>, maintained by IBM, remains available. Beginners looking for a tool designed to ease them into both Java programming and the world of Java IDEs can check out <a href="https://oreil.ly/QcZ_I">BlueJ</a>, created by King’s College London.</p>&#13;

<h1>Grabbing the Main Code Examples</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>No matter which IDE or editor you use, you’ll want to grab the code examples for the book from GitHub. While we often include complete source listings when discussing particular topics, many times we chose to leave out things like <code>import</code> or <code>package</code> statements, or the enclosing <code>class</code> structure for brevity and readability. The downloadable code examples aim to be complete to help reinforce the discussions in the book.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can visit GitHub in a browser to meander through the individual examples without downloading anything. Just head to the <a href="https://github.com/l0y/learnjava6e"><em>learnjava6e</em> repository</a>. (If that link doesn’t work, just go to <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://github.com">github.com</a> and search for the term “learnjava6e.”) It might be worth poking around GitHub generally as it has become the primary watering hole for open source developers and even corporate teams. You can look over the history of a repository as well as report bugs and discuss issues related to the code.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The site’s name refers to the <em>git</em> tool, a source code control system or source code manager, that developers use to manage revisions among teams for code projects. But recall from <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#learnjava6-CHP-2-FIG-10">Figure 2-14</a> that you don’t have to use <em>git</em>. You can just grab the whole batch of examples by downloading the main branch of the project as a <a href="https://oreil.ly/HoZrA">ZIP archive</a>. Once it’s downloaded, just unzip the file into a folder where you can easily find the examples. You should see a folder structure similar to <a data-type="xref" href="#learnjava6-APP-A-FIG-1">Figure A-2</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;

</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you’re curious about Git but your system does not already have the <em>git</em> command available, you can download it from the <a href="https://oreil.ly/YfF4H">Git website</a>. GitHub has its own site to help you learn about <em>git</em> at <a class="orm:hideurl" href="http://try.github.io/">try.github.io</a>. Once <em>git</em> is installed, you can clone the project to a folder on your computer. You can work from that clone or keep it as a clean copy of the code examples. As a small bonus, if we publish any fixes or updates down the road, you can also easily sync your cloned folder.</p>&#13;

<h1>Importing the Examples</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Before we import anything into IntelliJ IDEA, you may want to rename the folder where you downloaded the code examples from GitHub. After cloning or unzipping, you likely have a folder named <em>learnjava6e-main</em>. That’s a perfectly fine name, but if you want something friendlier (or shorter), go ahead and rename the folder now. We chose to rename the folder <em>learnjava6e</em> (without the <em>-main</em> suffix).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Start IntelliJ IDEA and select the Open option from the welcome screen shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#learnjava6-APP-A-FIG-idea-start">Figure A-3</a>. If you have already used IntelliJ IDEA and don’t see the welcome screen, you can also select File → Open from the menu bar.</p>&#13;
&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure A-3. </span>The IntelliJ IDEA welcome screen</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Navigate to your code example folder, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#learnjava6-APP-A-FIG-5">Figure A-4</a>. Be sure you select the top folder containing all of the chapters, not one of the individual chapter folders.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="learnjava6-APP-A-FIG-5">&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure A-4. </span>Importing the code examples folder</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>After opening the examples folder, you might be asked to “trust” the folder containing the examples. IDEA asks this question to confirm that the potentially executable classes in the folder are safe to run.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You may also need to specify the version of Java you want to use for compiling and running the examples. Using the project hierarchy on the left, open the <em>ch02/examples</em> folder and click on the <code>HelloJava</code> class. The source file for our class should appear on the right. If you see a pale yellow banner similar to the one shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#learnjava6-APP-A-FIG-ide-set-jdk">Figure A-5</a>, click on the Setup SDK linked text in the upper-right corner. (<em>SDK</em> stands for Software Development Kit, and in our case, it’s synonymous with JDK.) Pick the JDK you want to use from the dialog that appears.</p>&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure A-5. </span>Selecting a JDK</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For this example, we chose the long-term support version (21), but you can choose anything version 19 or greater that you may have installed.<a data-primary="" data-startref="ix_code_ex" data-type="indexterm" id="id2586"/><a data-primary="" data-startref="ix_idea_intellij2" data-type="indexterm" id="id2587"/><a data-primary="" data-startref="ix_intellij_idea2" data-type="indexterm" id="id2588"/><a data-primary="" data-startref="ix_swing_api" data-type="indexterm" id="id2589"/> (You can always change your selection or enable preview features using the File → Project Structure dialog shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#learnjava6-APP-A-FIG-idea-enable-preview">Figure A-1</a>.)</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To check that everything is working, right-click on the <code>HelloJava</code> class in the tree on the left and select the Run HelloJava.main() item from the context menu.</p>&#13;
