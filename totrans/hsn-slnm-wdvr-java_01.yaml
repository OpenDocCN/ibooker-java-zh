- en: 'Selenium is an open source umbrella project composed of three core components:
    WebDriver, Grid, and IDE. Selenium provides advanced capabilities for browser
    automation that practitioners typically use for implementing end-to-end tests
    for web applications. This first part of the book is a comprehensive overview
    of the Selenium project and its ecosystem. Moreover, it provides a primer on the
    software testing theory, focusing on its practical applications for Selenium WebDriver.
    Finally, you will discover how to set up a project (using Maven or Gradle) for
    developing WebDriver tests. For the sake of completeness, I cover different alternatives
    regarding the unit testing framework used to embed the calls to the Selenium WebDriver
    API, namely, JUnit 4, JUnit 5 (alone or extended by Selenium-Jupiter), and TestNG.'
