<h1>Preface</h1>


<p>We’re excited to have you with us on this journey of learning and using Quarkus!
Unlike traditional Java frameworks, which can be big, cumbersome, heavy-weight, and take months to learn, Quarkus builds on knowledge you already have!
It uses JPA, JAX-RS, Eclipse Vert.x, Eclipse MicroProfile, and CDI, just to name a few technologies you’re already familiar with.
Quarkus then takes your knowledge and combines it into a compact, easy-to-deploy, fully Kubernetes-optimized container targeting either OpenJDK Hotspot or GraalVM.
This allows you to pack your Kubernetes cluster as tightly as possible, making use of every resource on the machine as your application scales to meet demand.
Regardless of where you are on your migration to Kubernetes, you’ll find something useful with Quarkus, and this book will give you the tools and resources you need to succeed.</p>

<h1>Who Should Read This Book</h1>

<p>Obviously, we want everyone to read this book!
However, we have made some assumptions about the reader:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>You are already familiar with Java and application development within that space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You understand traditional software development practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You regularly deploy services into a cluster of machines or into the cloud.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Why We Wrote This Book"><div class="sect1" id="idm45128543588248">
<h1>Why We Wrote This Book</h1>

<p>Quarkus is a relatively new framework in a new space (native Java and GraalVM).
We wanted to dive into some more examples and how-to sections than what you will find on the internet.
Also, we wanted to give you as much substance with this book as possible.
There’s no large application to understand or remember.
All the examples in this book are self-contained and ready to be used.
We hope you keep this as a reference for all your Quarkus development!</p>

<h1>Navigating This Book</h1>

<p>The organization of the chapters is fairly loose, but it basically flows as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch01.xhtml#quarkus_overview_chapter">1</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch02.xhtml#scaffolding_chapter">2</a> introduce you to Quarkus and get your basic project set up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch03.xhtml#developing_restful_services_chapter">3</a> through <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch06.xhtml#packaging_quark_applications_chapter">6</a> introduce the bread-and-butter portion of Quarkus: RESTful applications built using concepts from CDI and Eclipse MicroProfile. These chapters also show you how to package your application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch07.xhtml#persistence_chapter">7</a> through <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch14.xhtml#developing_quarkus_chapter">14</a> relate to harder, though just as important, concepts such as fault tolerance, persistence, security, and interaction with other services. You will also learn about additional integrations Quarkus has with Kubernetes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch15.xhtml#working_with_a_reactive_programming_model_chapter">15</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch16.xhtml#additional-quarkus-features-chapter">16</a> talk about reactive programming using Quarkus and some additional functionality of the framework such as templating, scheduling, and OpenAPI.</p>

</ul>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Acknowledgments"><div class="sect1" id="idm45128543725512">
<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p><strong>Jason Porter</strong>: What do you do during quarantine?
You write a book, of course!
Thank you to all those brave people on the front lines of health care.
I’d like to thank the team behind both Quarkus and GraalVM for giving us an amazing tool and fun development experience.
I’ve been developing software for over 20 years, and Quarkus brings back the enjoyment I had back when first learning about software development.
A great thanks goes out to Georgios Andrianakis and Daniel Hinojosa for 
<span class="keep-together">providing</span> us with a technical review of the book!
Your work has helped us create something that is accessible, useful, and hopefully enjoyable to those learning Quarkus.
I would also like to thank Red Hat for allowing me the opportunity to write the book.
Alex, thank you for asking me once again to work with you on a book!
Lastly, thank you to my five children (Kaili, Emily, Zackary, Nicolas, and Rebecca) and wife, Tessie, for putting up with me writing another book, despite me saying I wouldn’t do it again.
Love you all!</p>

<p><strong>Alex Soto Bueno</strong>: This book was finished during the COVID-19 pandemic, so first of all I’d like to thank all the health care workers who are taking care of all us.
I would also like to thank the Red Hat Developers team, specially Burr Sutter, for allowing me the opportunity to write the book.
Jason, as always, it was a pleasure to write a book with you.
Lastly, thank you to my parents; my wife, Jessica; and my daughters, Ada and Alexandra; for their patience while I was writing the book, because there is no one without two.
Thank you very much for everything.</p>
