- en: Writing this book—and keeping it up to date—has been a humbling experience.
    It has taken far longer than I had predicted or than I would like to admit. And,
    of course, it’s not finished yet. Despite my best efforts and those of the technical
    reviewers, editors, and many other talented folks, a book this size is bound to
    contain errors, omissions, and passages that are less clear than they might be.
    Do let us know if you happen across any of these things; you can view and submit
    errata through them the [book’s catalog page](https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920304371.do).
    Subsequent editions will incorporate changes sent in by readers just like you!

    I have found this true of lecturing, and I find it equally true of writing.

    to study hard and know almost everything about it. After a release or two, this
    was no longer true. Today, nobody in his or her right mind would seriously claim
    to “know all about Java”—if they do, it should cause your bogosity detector to
    go off at full volume. And the amount you need to know keeps growing. How can
    you keep up? Java books? Java magazines? Java courses? Conferences? There is no
    single answer; all of these are useful to some people. Oracle and others have
    programs that you should be aware of:'

    and briefly by Oracle. Recently, Oracle has folded this into [Code One](https://oracle.com/code-one),
    the annual Oracle conference.

    to be several Java-related magazines published in print, some of whose articles
    would appear on the web. Today there are, so far as I know, no print magazines
    dedicated to Java. Oracle currently (2020) publishes the online-only *Java Magazine*
    every month with technical articles on many aspects of Java (including some by
    yours truly); see [the magazine’s website](https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine)
    to view the latest issue and back issues.
