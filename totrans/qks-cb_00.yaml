- en: We’re excited to have you with us on this journey of learning and using Quarkus!
    Unlike traditional Java frameworks, which can be big, cumbersome, heavy-weight,
    and take months to learn, Quarkus builds on knowledge you already have! It uses
    JPA, JAX-RS, Eclipse Vert.x, Eclipse MicroProfile, and CDI, just to name a few
    technologies you’re already familiar with. Quarkus then takes your knowledge and
    combines it into a compact, easy-to-deploy, fully Kubernetes-optimized container
    targeting either OpenJDK Hotspot or GraalVM. This allows you to pack your Kubernetes
    cluster as tightly as possible, making use of every resource on the machine as
    your application scales to meet demand. Regardless of where you are on your migration
    to Kubernetes, you’ll find something useful with Quarkus, and this book will give
    you the tools and resources you need to succeed.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Quarkus is a relatively new framework in a new space (native Java and GraalVM).
    We wanted to dive into some more examples and how-to sections than what you will
    find on the internet. Also, we wanted to give you as much substance with this
    book as possible. There’s no large application to understand or remember. All
    the examples in this book are self-contained and ready to be used. We hope you
    keep this as a reference for all your Quarkus development!

- en: '**Jason Porter**: What do you do during quarantine? You write a book, of course!
    Thank you to all those brave people on the front lines of health care. I’d like
    to thank the team behind both Quarkus and GraalVM for giving us an amazing tool
    and fun development experience. I’ve been developing software for over 20 years,
    and Quarkus brings back the enjoyment I had back when first learning about software
    development. A great thanks goes out to Georgios Andrianakis and Daniel Hinojosa
    for providing us with a technical review of the book! Your work has helped us
    create something that is accessible, useful, and hopefully enjoyable to those
    learning Quarkus. I would also like to thank Red Hat for allowing me the opportunity
    to write the book. Alex, thank you for asking me once again to work with you on
    a book! Lastly, thank you to my five children (Kaili, Emily, Zackary, Nicolas,
    and Rebecca) and wife, Tessie, for putting up with me writing another book, despite
    me saying I wouldn’t do it again. Love you all!'

    first of all I’d like to thank all the health care workers who are taking care
    of all us. I would also like to thank the Red Hat Developers team, specially Burr
    Sutter, for allowing me the opportunity to write the book. Jason, as always, it
    was a pleasure to write a book with you. Lastly, thank you to my parents; my wife,
    Jessica; and my daughters, Ada and Alexandra; for their patience while I was writing
    the book, because there is no one without two. Thank you very much for everything.'
